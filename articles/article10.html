      <p>
        Smart technology has become a part of everyday life—voice assistants answering our questions, smart locks securing our doors, 
        and wearable devices tracking our health. But with convenience comes risk. 
        What if your devices are not just serving you, but also silently spying, tracking, or even opening the door to cybercriminals?
      </p>

      <h2>When Smart Devices Turn Against You</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine waking up to find your smart TV recording conversations, or your security camera hacked by a stranger across the globe. 
        These scenarios aren’t fiction—they have happened. 
        The more connected we are, the more opportunities hackers have to exploit weaknesses.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Risks of Smart Tech</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Devices often store personal information, making them targets for hackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> Cameras and microphones can be hijacked to spy on you.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> Weak passwords and unprotected networks can expose sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Intrusion:</strong> Malicious actors can use smart locks, thermostats, or even cars against you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Stay Protected</h2>
      <p>
        Fear doesn’t mean abandoning technology—it means using it wisely. 
        Here are some practical steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always change default passwords on new devices.</li>
        <li>Keep software and firmware updated.</li>
        <li>Use two-factor authentication where possible.</li>
        <li>Disable microphones and cameras when not needed.</li>
        <li>Connect devices to a secure, private Wi-Fi network.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Balancing Convenience with Security</h2>
      <p>
        Smart technology can make life smoother, but it should not come at the cost of safety. 
        Think of your devices as digital doors: you wouldn’t leave your front door unlocked, so why leave your data exposed?
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        The rise of smart devices is exciting—but also unsettling. 
        Staying safe in a connected world requires awareness, caution, and a willingness to take digital hygiene seriously. 
        Enjoy the benefits, but never forget: every smart device is only as safe as the person using it.
