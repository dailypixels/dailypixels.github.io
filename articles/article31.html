      <p>
        Water makes up about 60% of the human body, yet many people underestimate its importance. 
        From keeping your energy levels steady to protecting vital organs, hydration is one of the 
        simplest and most effective steps you can take for better health.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Water Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Every cell, tissue, and organ in your body depends on water. It regulates temperature, 
        transports nutrients, flushes out toxins, and cushions your joints. Without enough hydration, 
        the body struggles to perform even basic functions.
      </p>

      <h2>Boosting Energy and Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Feeling sluggish? Even mild dehydration can cause fatigue, headaches, and poor concentration. 
        Drinking water throughout the day helps keep your brain sharp and your energy stable.
      </p>

      <h2>Healthy Skin and Digestion</h2>
      <p>
        Hydration also plays a big role in skin health. When you drink enough water, 
        your skin looks fresher and feels more supple. Water aids digestion too, helping prevent constipation 
        and keeping your gut functioning smoothly.
      </p>

      <h2>How Much Water Do You Need?</h2>
      <p>
        The common guideline is about 8 glasses a day, but individual needs vary depending on 
        age, activity level, and climate. A good rule of thumb is to drink when you’re thirsty 
        and keep an eye on urine color — light yellow usually means good hydration.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Staying Hydrated</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Carry a reusable water bottle everywhere you go.</li>
        <li>Add lemon, cucumber, or mint for natural flavor.</li>
        <li>Set reminders on your phone if you often forget to drink water.</li>
        <li>Eat water-rich foods like watermelon, cucumber, and oranges.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Drinking water may be simple, but its impact on your health is powerful. 
        By staying hydrated, you support your body, improve your energy, 
        and boost your overall wellness. So grab that glass of water—your body will thank you.
