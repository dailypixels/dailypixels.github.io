      <p>
        Time feels like the one thing we never have enough of. 
        Between work deadlines, personal commitments, and endless notifications, 
        it’s easy to feel stretched too thin. But effective time management 
        isn’t about squeezing more hours into the day—it’s about using the hours you have wisely.
      </p>

      <h2>The Cost of Poor Time Management</h2>
      <p>
        Without structure, tasks pile up, stress builds, and productivity plummets. 
        Many professionals burn out not because they work too little, 
        but because they work inefficiently—constantly switching between tasks, 
        reacting instead of planning.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Principles of Effective Time Management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> Focus on high-value tasks instead of busywork.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Use daily or weekly schedules to map out your time.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect:</strong> Block distractions and set boundaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Pause:</strong> Take breaks to recharge—productivity isn’t about nonstop work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Popular Strategies That Work</h2>
      <p>
        There isn’t one perfect method for everyone, but here are a few tested approaches:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pomodoro Technique:</strong> Work in 25-minute sprints with short breaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Eisenhower Matrix:</strong> Categorize tasks by importance and urgency.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Blocking:</strong> Reserve specific hours for focused work, meetings, and rest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Maintaining Work-Life Balance</h2>
      <p>
        Productivity should serve your life, not consume it. 
        Learning to say no, setting realistic expectations, and unplugging after hours 
        are all part of sustainable success. Remember: rest is not wasted time—it’s fuel for future progress.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Mastering time management doesn’t mean you’ll suddenly control every minute of your life. 
        Instead, it gives you clarity and balance. By working smarter, not harder, 
        you create space for what truly matters—your health, relationships, and long-term goals.
