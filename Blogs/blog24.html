        Cinema has always been a powerful medium for storytelling, cultural expression, and entertainment. From silent films of the early 20th century to the streaming era of today, movies have evolved in style, technology, and accessibility, shaping how audiences experience stories around the world.
      </p>

      <h2>The Birth of Cinema</h2>
      <p>
        The origins of cinema trace back to the late 1800s, with pioneers like the Lumière brothers creating short, silent films that captured everyday life. Early cinema focused on experimentation with motion and narrative, laying the groundwork for storytelling through moving images.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 1930s–1950s are considered the Golden Age of Hollywood, marked by iconic films, legendary actors, and studio systems that controlled production, distribution, and exhibition. Classics like “Casablanca,” “Gone with the Wind,” and “Citizen Kane” set standards for narrative, cinematography, and performance that still influence filmmakers today.
      </p>
