      <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        AI refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making. AI can be categorized into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Systems designed for specific tasks, like virtual assistants or recommendation engines.</li>
        <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Hypothetical AI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Algorithms that improve performance based on data and experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A subset of machine learning using neural networks for complex pattern recognition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI Applications in Everyday Life</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant for convenience and smart home control.</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.</li>
        <li>Autonomous vehicles and drones for transportation and logistics.</li>
        <li>Healthcare: AI-powered diagnostics, predictive analytics, and personalized treatment plans.</li>
        <li>Finance: Fraud detection, automated trading, and customer service chatbots.</li>
        <li>Smart manufacturing and robotics for efficient production processes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits of AI</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhances efficiency by automating repetitive and complex tasks.</li>
        <li>Improves decision-making with data-driven insights.</li>
        <li>Enables innovative products, services, and business models.</li>
        <li>Supports scientific research and problem-solving in various fields.</li>
        <li>Reduces human error and increases safety in high-risk industries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges and Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Job displacement and the need for workforce reskilling.</li>
        <li>Bias and fairness in AI decision-making processes.</li>
        <li>Privacy concerns regarding data collection and usage.</li>
        <li>Security risks from AI-driven cyber threats.</li>
        <li>Ensuring transparency, accountability, and ethical AI deployment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
      <p>
        The future of AI promises continued innovation and transformation. Advancements in natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and autonomous systems will redefine industries, education, healthcare, and daily life.
