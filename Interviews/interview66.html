    <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> is one of the most polarizing innovators of our time — from electric cars to rockets returning from space, his vision pushes the boundaries of what humanity believes is possible.</p>

<h2>Q1 — SpaceX aims to take humans to Mars. Why is that mission so important?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> I think it’s essential for the survival of our species. If something happens to Earth — we need a backup. Mars is the first step to becoming a multiplanetary civilization.</p>

<h2>Q2 — What keeps you motivated when failures happen?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> Failure means you're trying something worthwhile. Every rocket explosion taught us something new. If you’re not failing, you’re not innovating.</p>

<h2>Q3 — People say your risks are too big. What do you say?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> Humanity didn’t progress by playing safe. I'm okay with personal risk if it pushes civilization forward.</p>

<h2>Q4 — Your thoughts on AI — fear or opportunity?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> Both. AI could be humanity’s greatest invention — or its biggest threat. We must develop it responsibly, with guardrails to protect the future.</p>

<h2>Q5 — You work across cars, rockets, neural-tech — isn’t it overwhelming?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> My brain doesn’t like staying in one place. When I’m working on big problems, that’s when I feel alive.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Elon Musk’s life reminds us that innovation isn’t comfortable — it’s messy, expensive, and full of criticism. Yet, his ambition challenges the world to think bigger, act bolder, and prepare for a future beyond Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The future is built by those who are willing to take risks that others fear.</p>
