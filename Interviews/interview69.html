    <p><strong>Mohammad Rizwan</strong> is the heartbeat of Pakistan cricket — a fighter who turns challenges into fuel. From domestic struggles to becoming one of the world’s most consistent wicketkeeper-batsmen, his story is built on faith, humility, and absolute dedication.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Your journey is known for perseverance. What kept you going?</h2>
<p><strong>Rizwan:</strong> Faith. Allah plans everything better than we ever can. I worked hard, stayed patient, and trusted His timing.</p>

<h2>Q2 — You often perform under pressure. What’s your mindset in tough situations?</h2>
<p><strong>Rizwan:</strong> Pressure is motivation. I remind myself of my purpose — to serve my team and my country. When the badge is on your chest, fear disappears.</p>

<h2>Q3 — How do you balance aggressive cricket with humility?</h2>
<p><strong>Rizwan:</strong> Aggression is in performance, not attitude. Respect for teammates, opponents, and the game — that’s real sportsmanship.</p>

<h2>Q4 — You’re known for fitness and discipline. What drives that commitment?</h2>
<p><strong>Rizwan:</strong> Discipline is the foundation of success. If you sacrifice today, tomorrow will thank you. Fitness gives me confidence to play long and strong.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What’s next for Mohammad Rizwan?</h2>
<p><strong>Rizwan:</strong> More contribution, more learning. Records come and go — I want to be remembered as someone who gave every heartbeat to Pakistan cricket.</p>
