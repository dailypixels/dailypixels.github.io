   <p><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong> has already secured his legacy as one of the greatest actors of our time. But his passion extends far beyond the film industry. As an environmental activist, he continues to use his voice and influence to fight for the future of our planet. In this powerful conversation, Leonardo opens up about purpose, storytelling, and the responsibility that comes with global recognition.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Your career has given us unforgettable performances. What still motivates you?</h2>
<p><strong>Leonardo:</strong> Curiosity. Every role is a chance to explore a new world, a new mindset, a new emotional truth. Acting keeps me connected to humanity — in all its beauty and flaws.</p>

<h2>Q2 — You commit deeply to your characters. How do you choose a role?</h2>
<p><strong>Leonardo:</strong> I look for stories that challenge me and leave an impact. Cinema has the power to spark change. If a film can start a conversation or shift perspective — that’s meaningful.</p>

<h2>Q3 — Your environmental activism has become a crucial part of your identity. Why is it so important to you?</h2>
<p><strong>Leonardo:</strong> Because it’s urgent. Our planet is in danger, and we can’t wait for someone else to fix things. We all have a responsibility to protect the Earth — it’s the only home we have.</p>

<h2>Q4 — What message do you hope your fans — especially young people — take from your advocacy?</h2>
<p><strong>Leonardo:</strong> That their voice matters. Small steps matter. Change is built through millions of actions, not just one. If you care and you act, you’re already part of the solution.</p>

<h2>Q5 — Any upcoming projects you're excited about?</h2>
<p><strong>Leonardo:</strong> Yes — new films that explore human resilience and environmental themes. I want to continue merging storytelling with purpose. There’s so much more work to do.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio reminds us that success is not complete unless it serves something greater. His work — both in cinema and conservation — calls us to be more aware, more responsible, and more hopeful.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Purpose gives passion direction — and Leonardo continues to use his influence where the world needs it most.</p>
