    <p><strong>RM (Kim Namjoon)</strong>, leader of BTS, is known for his eloquence, vision, and deep introspection. Beyond his rap and songwriting, he is a thoughtful leader whose influence has helped guide BTS into a cultural phenomenon. In this interview, RM discusses creativity, responsibility, and the philosophy that drives both him and his team.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You’ve been a leader from a young age. What does leadership mean to you?</h2>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Leadership is about listening more than speaking. It’s about understanding each member, helping them grow, and aligning their strengths with our shared goals. Responsibility is not pressure — it’s purpose.</p>

<h2>Q2 — BTS has impacted millions worldwide. How do you stay grounded?</h2>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Reflection and learning. I spend time reading, writing, and thinking about the world beyond music. Understanding yourself makes it easier to relate to others, and to handle attention responsibly.</p>

<h2>Q3 — Your lyrics are often philosophical. Where do you find inspiration?</h2>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Life itself. Art, literature, history, people I meet, challenges we face. I write to communicate — not just for performance, but to connect minds and hearts across cultures.</p>

<h2>Q4 — Mental health is a topic BTS emphasizes. How do you approach it personally?</h2>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Awareness and acceptance. Everyone struggles, and it’s okay to ask for help. I reflect, meditate, and express my thoughts in music. Sharing that honesty is part of my leadership.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What’s next for you and BTS?</h2>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Growth — musically, personally, globally. We want to keep creating music that resonates, that challenges, that heals. And we want to continue using our platform for positive impact.</p>
