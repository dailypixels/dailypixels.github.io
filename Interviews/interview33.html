    <p><strong>Johnny Depp</strong> has portrayed some of cinema’s most unforgettable characters — from Captain Jack Sparrow to Edward Scissorhands. Behind the artistry lies a man who has faced storms and still chooses expression over silence. In this candid conversation, Johnny speaks about vulnerability, creativity, and a new chapter built on truth and passion.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You’ve created characters that became cultural icons. How do you choose your roles now?</h2>
<p><strong>Johnny:</strong> I listen for the whisper. Every fictional soul has a heartbeat. If I feel that pulse — that strangeness, that beauty — I follow it.</p>

<h2>Q2 — After personal challenges, you’ve returned strong. What helped you stay grounded?</h2>
<p><strong>Johnny:</strong> Love. From my kids, from real friends, from the people who saw the human being behind the headlines. Art heals too — it always has.</p>

<h2>Q3 — Do you feel pressure to prove anything anymore?</h2>
<p><strong>Johnny:</strong> No. The only thing I owe is honesty. If the work comes from a truthful place, then it has value — no matter what anyone thinks.</p>

<h2>Q4 — How would you describe your relationship with your fans?</h2>
<p><strong>Johnny:</strong> They’ve been my compass when I felt lost. They give me a reason to show up — with gratitude, always.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What excites you most about the future?</h2>
<p><strong>Johnny:</strong> Freedom. New stories. Music. Laughter. I want to create without fear — and enjoy every moment left in this wild, beautiful adventure.</p>
