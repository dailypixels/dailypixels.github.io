    <p><strong>MS Dhoni</strong> — a name that transformed Indian cricket. The man known for cold nerves, sharp strategy, and winning with humility became a symbol of trust for millions.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You are famous for staying calm in every situation. What’s your secret?</h2>
<p><strong>Dhoni:</strong> Panic doesn’t help. When pressure rises, the mind must stay clear. Focus on what you can control — the next ball, the next decision.</p>

<h2>Q2 — What defines a strong leader in cricket?</h2>
<p><strong>Dhoni:</strong> A leader listens. You trust your players, give them space to grow, and take responsibility when things go wrong.</p>

<h2>Q3 — You’ve finished so many games for India. How do you handle those tense moments?</h2>
<p><strong>Dhoni:</strong> Silence tells you everything. I watch the field, the bowler’s body language, the pitch. Then I wait for the right ball to finish it.</p>

<h2>Q4 — What does your journey from Ranchi mean to you?</h2>
<p><strong>Dhoni:</strong> I’m grateful. Nothing was guaranteed. Hard work and the support of people around me made everything possible.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What would you like young cricketers to learn from you?</h2>
<p><strong>Dhoni:</strong> Forget the noise. Find what makes you strong — and do it every single day. Success follows discipline.</p>
