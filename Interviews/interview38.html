   <p><strong>Hrithik Roshan</strong> is widely celebrated for his extraordinary acting range, unmatched dance talent, and incredible physical transformation. But behind the glamour lies a story of resilience — from health challenges to personal struggles — that shaped him into a symbol of strength. In this inspiring conversation, Hrithik opens up about discipline, vulnerability, and finding purpose in the spotlight.</p>

<h2>Q1 — People admire your fitness and confidence. What drives your discipline?</h2>
<p><strong>Hrithik:</strong> I wasn’t always confident. I had a stutter growing up, a spine condition that doctors said would stop me from dancing. Discipline became my superpower — the choice to improve a little every day. Progress is a lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Q2 — You’ve played both superheroes and deeply emotional characters. How do you choose roles?</h2>
<p><strong>Hrithik:</strong> I look for stories that challenge me — physically, mentally, spiritually. When a role scares me, that’s the one I want to do. It means there’s something to learn from it.</p>

<h2>Q3 — What has been your greatest personal lesson so far?</h2>
<p><strong>Hrithik:</strong> Self-love. We are often our toughest critics. I learned that acknowledging flaws doesn’t make you weak — it makes you human. Growth begins when you accept yourself fully.</p>

<h2>Q4 — Fans often see you as a perfectionist. How do you handle pressure?</h2>
<p><strong>Hrithik:</strong> Pressure means people believe in me. I transform that into gratitude. And when it gets heavy, I go back to basics: breathing, training, spending time with my kids. Balance keeps me aligned with who I really am.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What excites you most about the future?</h2>
<p><strong>Hrithik:</strong> Reinvention. There are new genres, global collaborations, and new versions of myself waiting to be discovered. As long as I keep evolving — as an artist and a human — I’m satisfied.</p>
