    <p><strong>Billie Eilish</strong> has transformed pop music with her fearless originality and deep emotional honesty. From bedroom recordings to global stages, she has maintained a distinct voice that resonates with millions.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Your style and music are unique. How did you find your authentic voice?</h2>
<p><strong>Billie:</strong> I stopped trying to fit in. I focus on what feels real to me — the sounds, lyrics, and visuals that match my personality. Authenticity comes naturally when you stop overthinking.</p>

<h2>Q2 — Fame can be overwhelming. How do you protect your mental health?</h2>
<p><strong>Billie:</strong> Boundaries, therapy, and trust in my team. I take breaks when needed, unplug, and focus on the things that matter — my family, friends, and creative freedom.</p>

<h2>Q3 — How do you handle public scrutiny or criticism?</h2>
<p><strong>Billie:</strong> I remind myself I can’t please everyone. Art is subjective. I focus on making music that feels true to me and supports my fans’ connection to the work.</p>

<h2>Q4 — What inspires your songwriting today?</h2>
<p><strong>Billie:</strong> Emotions, life experiences, and stories that are often hidden. I like to explore mental health, identity, and feelings that people sometimes keep private.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What’s next for Billie Eilish?</h2>
<p><strong>Billie:</strong> More experimentation. Collaborations. Growth as an artist and person. I want to continue redefining expectations while staying honest to myself.</p>
