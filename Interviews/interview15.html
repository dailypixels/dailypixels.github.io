  <main class="story-content">
    <p><strong>Donald J. Trump</strong> — businessman, television personality, and former U.S. President — has long been a figure who thrives on disruption and dominance. In this exclusive 2025 conversation, Trump opens up about his approach to leadership, the value of confidence, and why risk-taking has been central to his life and career.</p>

<h2>Q: Mr. Trump, what’s your definition of leadership?</h2>
<p><strong>Donald Trump:</strong> Leadership is about vision and confidence. People follow strength. If you don’t believe in yourself, no one else will. Whether in business or politics, you need to project certainty — even when things get tough. Weakness never wins. I’ve always said: think big, act bigger.</p>

<h2>Q: You’ve built an empire, faced major challenges, and entered politics. What drives you to keep taking risks?</h2>
<p><strong>Donald Trump:</strong> I’ve always believed that comfort kills ambition. If you want something great, you’ve got to take the shot. You win some, you lose some — but you never stop playing the game. I enjoy challenges; they keep you sharp. Every failure I ever had taught me more than any success did.</p>

<h2>Q: What role does confidence play in success?</h2>
<p><strong>Donald Trump:</strong> Confidence is everything. People sense it immediately. When I negotiate or speak publicly, I do it with total belief. That energy spreads. You can have all the facts and plans, but if you don’t project power, no one listens. Confidence is contagious — so is doubt. Choose wisely.</p>

<h2>Q: You’ve been one of the most polarizing leaders in modern history. How do you handle criticism?</h2>
<p><strong>Donald Trump:</strong> Critics are part of success. If everyone agrees with you, you’re not doing anything important. I don’t waste time worrying about opinions — I focus on outcomes. You have to build a thick skin. Success attracts both fans and enemies. I take it as proof that I’m making an impact.</p>

<h2>Q: What’s your advice for young entrepreneurs starting out?</h2>
<p><strong>Donald Trump:</strong> Think big and protect your time. Surround yourself with loyal people — loyalty is rare but powerful. Learn negotiation like your life depends on it, because it does. And never stop learning. The smartest person in the room is usually the one still asking questions.</p>

<h2>Q: How do you see power — and how should a leader use it?</h2>
<p><strong>Donald Trump:</strong> Power should be used with purpose. You can’t lead by fear alone — but you also can’t lead by weakness. Real power comes from making decisions others are afraid to make. Leadership means getting results, not just applause. I respect people who deliver.</p>

<h2>Trump’s Rules of Success</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Think big:</strong> Small dreams create small results.</li>
  <li><strong>Negotiate hard:</strong> Every deal is a test of strength and patience.</li>
  <li><strong>Stay loyal:</strong> Loyalty builds empires; betrayal destroys them.</li>
  <li><strong>Be relentless:</strong> Winners keep moving when everyone else stops.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Donald Trump’s interview reveals a philosophy centered on confidence, resilience, and control. Whether one agrees with his politics or not, his approach to leadership is rooted in action over hesitation and strength over uncertainty — principles that resonate far beyond business and politics.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Leadership isn’t about perfection — it’s about conviction. Power, when guided by vision and persistence, can turn obstacles into opportunity and criticism into fuel. 💼🏛️🔥</p>
