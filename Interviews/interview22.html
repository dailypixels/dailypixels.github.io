  <main class="story-content">
   <p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong> isn’t just a cricketer — he is a relentless force of discipline, performance, and passion. Known for his fearless batting and fierce leadership, Kohli continues to inspire millions with his hunger for excellence and his belief that greatness is built, not born.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Virat, what continues to drive you after achieving so much in cricket?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> Every time I step on the field, I feel responsible — to give my best for my country. Records are fine, trophies are special, but commitment is what defines a player. That hunger keeps me alive.</p>

<h2>Q2 — You transformed your fitness and changed the culture of Indian cricket. What sparked that shift?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> I realized talent alone wouldn’t take me where I wanted to go. Fitness gave me clarity — stronger body, stronger mind. When you lead by example, others rise with you.</p>

<h2>Q3 — Pressure is part of your identity as a performer. How do you cope with expectations?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> Pressure is a privilege. It means people believe in you. I focus on the moment — one ball, one innings at a time. You cannot control the noise, but you can control your effort.</p>

<h2>Q4 — You are admired for your aggression and passion. Do you still carry that fire?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> Absolutely. Fire without direction is chaos, but fire with purpose is power. I’ve learned to channel it better now — less shouting, more scoring.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What message do you have for young athletes watching your journey?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> Don’t chase fame. Chase improvement. Every day, try to be better than your yesterday. Discipline will take you places talent cannot.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Virat Kohli reminds us that champions are made in small, unseen moments — early mornings, tough losses, and the courage to keep going. His success is the product of obsession, grit, and love for the game.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> True greatness is not measured by numbers, but by the heart and discipline behind them — and Virat Kohli’s heart beats for cricket like no other.</p>
