    <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> is known for chasing ideas that seem impossible — until they aren’t. From revolutionizing electric cars to rethinking space travel, his mission is simple: push the boundaries of what humanity can become.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Why is Mars so important for the future of humanity?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> Life needs a backup drive. If we want humanity to survive long-term, we must become a multi-planet species. Mars is the next step — challenging but achievable.</p>

<h2>Q2 — Critics say your goals are too ambitious. What keeps you going?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> If something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are against you. Progress comes from stubborn belief mixed with relentless action.</p>

<h2>Q3 — How do you balance AI development with safety?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> AI is the most powerful tool we will ever create. But power demands responsibility. We must ensure AI aligns with human values before it surpasses human capability.</p>

<h2>Q4 — Sustainability is a key part of your work at Tesla. What’s the long-term vision?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> Clean energy should be the default everywhere. The faster we transition, the better chance we have to protect our planet and future generations.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What advice do you have for young innovators?</h2>
<p><strong>Musk:</strong> Work hard on something meaningful. Failure is not the end — it’s data. Learn, adapt, and keep moving forward.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Elon Musk’s perspective challenges us to think beyond our limits — not just about what technology can do, but what humanity should become. His ambition reminds us that the world changes because of people who refuse to settle for what already exists.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The future belongs to those bold enough to design it, and persistent enough to build it.</p>
