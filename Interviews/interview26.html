   <p><strong>Narendra Modi</strong>, the Prime Minister of India, has guided a nation of over 1.4 billion people through rapid transformation, global engagement, and internal renewal. In this exclusive interview, he shares his perspectives on leadership, service, and his vision for the future of India.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Prime Minister, what do you see as the core purpose of leadership in this era?</h2>
<p><strong>Modi:</strong> Leadership is service. It’s not about power, but responsibility. If you are entrusted by millions, you must dedicate yourself to their hopes and dreams. For India, leadership means building opportunity, equality, and hope for every citizen.</p>

<h2>Q2 — Your journey from modest beginnings to the highest office is well-known. How does that shape your approach?</h2>
<p><strong>Modi:</strong> Growing up in a small village taught me humility, discipline and urgency. When you see hardship firsthand, you understand the value of every policy, every program. My roots remind me that progress cannot leave anyone behind.</p>

<h2>Q3 — India is changing fast — digital growth, youth ambitions, global partnerships. What’s your biggest challenge?</h2>
<p><strong>Modi:</strong> Balancing speed with inclusion. We must move ahead with technology, economy and global integration — but also ensure that the remote village, the marginalised youth, the silent citizen all share in our progress. That is my deepest focus.</p>

<h2>Q4 — You’ve often emphasised vision over short-term gains. Why?</h2>
<p><strong>Modi:</strong> If you focus only on immediate results, you build fleeting success. True change takes years, decades. I think in what India will become in 2047 — a developed nation of dignity and opportunity. Every decision is a step toward that horizon.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What message do you have for India’s youth, especially in a rapidly evolving world?</h2>
<p><strong>Modi:</strong> Dream big. Work hard. Respect tradition while embracing innovation. You are inheritors of a civilisation and creators of a future. Serve, lead, create — and let your actions lift thousands behind you.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Narendra Modi’s path from village life to global leadership reflects a belief: transformation is not just infrastructural, but human. His emphasis on service, vision and inclusive progress positions his work as more than politics—it’s a mission.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> True leadership isn’t about standing above others — it’s about standing for them. When vision is paired with service, the future becomes an opportunity, not a promise. 🌍🇮🇳</p>
