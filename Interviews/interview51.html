<h2>Q2 — Your stunts are legendary. Why take such risks?</h2>

<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Film is one of the greatest team sports. Every shot, every moment — hundreds of people contribute. Respecting the craft and the crew is everything to me.</p>

<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Discipline and gratitude. I’ve had incredible opportunities, and I never take them for granted. The harder the challenge, the more I grow.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What’s next for you?</h2>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Bigger stories, bigger scale — but always grounded in emotional truth. I want to keep inspiring audiences and honoring the art form that gave me everything.</p>
