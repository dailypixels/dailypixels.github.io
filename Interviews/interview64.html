    <p><strong>Emma Watson</strong> grew from a beloved childhood star into a global advocate for women’s rights and education. Known for her intelligence, grace, and determination, she continues to inspire millions through her activism and thoughtful choices.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Many remember you as Hermione Granger. How did you shift from acting into global activism?</h2>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> Hermione showed people a girl could be smart, brave, and powerful. I realized my voice could help real people — and I didn’t want to waste that opportunity.</p>

<h2>Q2 — You delivered the iconic HeForShe speech at the UN. What did that moment mean to you?</h2>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> It was terrifying and empowering. Speaking on a global stage about equality wasn’t about me — it was about opening a conversation the world needed.</p>

<h2>Q3 — Education seems to be a major theme in your life. Why is it so important?</h2>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> Education gives choice. It gives freedom. When girls are educated, entire families and communities rise. It’s the strongest tool for equality.</p>

<h2>Q4 — How do you cope with criticism while being a public figure?</h2>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> I remind myself that making a difference invites resistance. I focus on impact — not approval.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What is the next chapter for Emma Watson?</h2>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> Growth. More storytelling and more advocacy. I want to create spaces where women feel seen, safe, and unstoppable.</p>
