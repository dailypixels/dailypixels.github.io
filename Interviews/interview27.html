  <main class="story-content">
   <p><strong>Selena Gomez</strong> has grown up in front of the world — from the Disney stage to global music charts to business and activism. Today, she speaks with honesty about creativity, courage, and healing.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Selena, your career has evolved so much. How do you describe your relationship with fame now?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> Fame used to feel like pressure. Now I see it as a platform — a way to help others feel less alone. I don’t chase attention anymore. I chase authenticity.</p>

<h2>Q2 — You’ve been very open about mental health. Why is sharing so important to you?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> Because silence can be heavy. When I spoke about my struggles, I realized millions felt the same. If my voice gives someone strength, then it’s worth every moment of vulnerability.</p>

<h2>Q3 — Musically, what inspires you today?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> Real emotions. I want songs that feel like pages from a journal — imperfect, honest, hopeful. Music heals me, and I hope it heals others too.</p>

<h2>Q4 — You’ve stepped into filmmaking and beauty entrepreneurship. What drives that expansion?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> Creativity doesn’t belong in one box. Acting, writing, building a brand that encourages self-love — all of it comes from one place: wanting people to feel seen.</p>

<h2>Q5 — If you could leave one message for your younger fans, what would it be?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> You are enough, even when you don’t feel like it. You deserve love, including your own. Protect your heart, but don’t stop believing in it.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Selena’s story teaches that the spotlight isn’t what defines a person — what they choose to shine light on does. Her voice isn’t loud because she sings; it’s powerful because she speaks truth.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Healing is not an ending but a journey — and telling your story can help others survive theirs.</p>
