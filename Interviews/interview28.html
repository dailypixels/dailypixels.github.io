    <p><strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> has been one of the most influential and controversial figures of the 21st century. In this exclusive conversation, he speaks about power, history, and the challenges of leading a vast nation.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You’ve been a central figure in global politics for decades. How has leadership changed you?</h2>
<p><strong>Putin:</strong> Leadership is not about comfort. It demands sacrifice, discipline, and a clear understanding of responsibility. You learn to think beyond yourself — about the nation, its past and its future.</p>

<h2>Q2 — Many people around the world view you differently — some supportive, some critical. How do you see this?</h2>
<p><strong>Putin:</strong> Diverging opinions are part of leadership. History always judges in the end, not headlines. My work is measured in stability and national interests — not in popularity.</p>

<h2>Q3 — What is your vision of Russia’s role in the world?</h2>
<p><strong>Putin:</strong> Russia is a sovereign power with a long heritage. We aim for respect, multipolar cooperation, and a global stage where every nation has space to define its destiny.</p>

<h2>Q4 — Power can be isolating. Where do you find personal strength?</h2>
<p><strong>Putin:</strong> In discipline. In understanding history. And in believing that a leader must stand firm even when alone. A nation follows confidence, not uncertainty.</p>

<h2>Q5 — When the world looks back at your legacy, what do you hope they see?</h2>
<p><strong>Putin:</strong> A man who defended his country’s place in the world and did not fear difficult decisions. Whether one agrees or not — commitment is undeniable.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Putin’s responses reflect a leader who views power as duty, not comfort. His narrative emphasizes sovereignty, historical perspective, and relentless resolve — traits that shape leadership on a global scale.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Leadership on the world stage is judged by the balance of strength, responsibility, and the weight of decisions made for millions.</p>
