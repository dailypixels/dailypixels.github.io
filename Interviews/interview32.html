   <p><strong>LeBron James</strong> has redefined what it means to be a basketball icon. Beyond championship rings and MVP awards, LeBron stands tall as a leader, mentor, and champion for education and equality. In this in-depth interview, he speaks about pressure, purpose, and the responsibility of influence.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You’ve been called a once-in-a-generation athlete. What motivates you today?</h2>
<p><strong>LeBron:</strong> Growth. Every season is a new book. New lessons, new opportunities. I'm still hungry — not for records, but for impact.</p>

<h2>Q2 — How do you balance family, legacy, and expectation?</h2>
<p><strong>LeBron:</strong> Priorities. My family is my foundation. When I’m centered there, everything else falls into place — basketball, business, causes I believe in.</p>

<h2>Q3 — Your foundation and “I Promise School” have changed lives. Why is education so personal to you?</h2>
<p><strong>LeBron:</strong> I was one of those kids. I know what uncertainty feels like. If we give children belief, safety, and opportunity — they’ll surprise the world.</p>

<h2>Q4 — What does leadership on and off the court look like to you?</h2>
<p><strong>LeBron:</strong> Listening. Lifting others up. Leadership isn’t the loudest voice — it’s the one that inspires movement.</p>

<h2>Q5 — How do you want future generations to remember LeBron James?</h2>
<p><strong>LeBron:</strong> As someone who showed up — for his people, his community, and his purpose. Rings age, but influence and love… that stays.</p>
