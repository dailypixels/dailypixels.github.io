    <p><strong>Bill Gates</strong> spent decades pushing the boundaries of personal computing. Today, he is driven by a new mission: using science, technology, and philanthropy to solve the world’s hardest problems. In this in-depth conversation, he talks climate, health, and what keeps him optimistic.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You’ve shifted from tech titan to global problem-solver. Why this mission?</h2>
<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Technology gave me a platform — now I want to use that influence to help society. Diseases, climate change, inequality… these are solvable problems if we combine innovation with urgency.</p>

<h2>Q2 — Many people worry technology is moving too fast. What’s your view?</h2>
<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Progress isn’t the problem — direction is. We must design technology that benefits everyone, not just a privileged few. Ethics and innovation need to evolve together.</p>

<h2>Q3 — Climate change is a topic you talk about often. What makes you hopeful?</h2>
<p><strong>Gates:</strong> The explosion of clean-energy innovation. Young people demanding accountability. Engineers, farmers, governments working together. Hope comes from action, not wishful thinking.</p>

<h2>Q4 — You’ve donated billions to health initiatives. Why healthcare?</h2>
<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Every life saved creates ripples of opportunity. Healthy children learn better, shape stronger communities, and build better futures. Health is the foundation of progress.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What advice do you have for future innovators?</h2>
<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Stay curious. Focus on real-world impact. Technology becomes meaningful when it improves someone’s life — even if it’s one life at a time.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Bill Gates reminds us that intelligence matters — but compassion directs intelligence toward good. He shows that the greatest achievements are not those that elevate one person, but those that uplift millions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Innovation becomes truly powerful when guided by purpose, empathy, and the desire to improve the world.</p>
