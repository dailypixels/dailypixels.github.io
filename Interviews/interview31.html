   <p><strong>Robert Downey Jr.</strong> has mastered what many in Hollywood fear — reinvention. From troubled past to beloved global icon, his journey is a testament to resilience, humor, and self-belief. In this interview, RDJ talks about the power of second chances and living life with purpose and style.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You’ve experienced peaks and valleys. What kept you moving forward?</h2>
<p><strong>RDJ:</strong> Curiosity. Even when life hits the fan, I think, “Okay, what’s the next scene?” Staying curious gives you the courage to keep improvising.</p>

<h2>Q2 — Iron Man changed everything. What did Tony Stark teach you?</h2>
<p><strong>RDJ:</strong> That redemption is cool. A flawed human being choosing to do better — that’s a hero. And hey, it never hurts to have a great suit.</p>

<h2>Q3 — How do you protect your creativity and mental peace today?</h2>
<p><strong>RDJ:</strong> Boundaries. I value stillness as much as success now. Meditation, family, and my little farm — they keep me grounded and grateful.</p>

<h2>Q4 — What excites you most about your career now?</h2>
<p><strong>RDJ:</strong> Risk. I want roles that scare me a bit. Reinvention isn’t a phase — it’s my favorite hobby.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What message do you hope your story gives to others?</h2>
<p><strong>RDJ:</strong> You are more than your worst chapters. Rewrite yourself. And have fun doing it — laughter is rocket fuel, my friend.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Reinvention doesn’t require perfection — only a decision to rise with heart and humor.</p>
