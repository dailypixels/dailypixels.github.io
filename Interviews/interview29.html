   <p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong> isn’t just a cricketer — he’s a symbol of discipline, aggression, and unwavering belief. From a young talent to a global icon, his journey continues to inspire millions. In this candid interview, Virat opens up about resilience, self-discovery, and what truly drives him.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You’ve seen highs and lows in your career. What keeps you mentally strong?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> I remind myself why I started. It was never about fame or trophies — it was the love for cricket. Pressure comes with success, but passion keeps you grounded.</p>

<h2>Q2 — People admire your intensity on the field. Where does that fire come from?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> From wanting to win for India — every single time. When I wear that jersey, I feel a responsibility. That emotion turns into energy, and that energy becomes performance.</p>

<h2>Q3 — You’ve embraced huge lifestyle changes around fitness. How did that transformation begin?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> Fitness changed everything for me. It improved my game, my mindset, and my longevity. Discipline in training became discipline in life. A strong mind needs a strong body.</p>

<h2>Q4 — Early criticism vs. later praise — how do you deal with judgement?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> Criticism teaches you. Praise tests you. I’ve learned not to take either too personally. Work hard silently — let results speak louder.</p>

<h2>Q5 — As a role model, what message do you want young athletes to take from you?</h2>
<p><strong>Virat:</strong> Believe in the grind. Talent starts the journey, but attitude decides how far you’ll go. Wake up every day with purpose — and protect that purpose fiercely.</p>
