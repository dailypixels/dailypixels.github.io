   <p><strong>Selena Gomez</strong> is more than a global superstar — she is a voice for compassion, mental health advocacy, and self-love. Through music, acting, and philanthropy, she continues to inspire a generation to embrace their true selves.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Selena, you’ve spoken openly about mental health. How has vulnerability shaped your journey?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> Vulnerability gave me freedom. I realized that pretending to be perfect doesn’t help anyone — especially not myself. Sharing my struggles helped me heal and also reminded others they’re not alone.</p>

<h2>Q2 — Music has always been your emotional outlet. What do you hope people take from your songs?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> I want my music to feel like a friend that understands you. Whether someone is going through heartbreak, anxiety, or growth — I hope my songs give them comfort and strength.</p>

<h2>Q3 — Fame comes with pressure. How do you protect your inner peace?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> I set boundaries. I cherish quiet time with the people who truly know me. And I remind myself every day that I deserve peace — not just applause.</p>

<h2>Q4 — What’s a message you would give to young fans struggling with identity or confidence?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> You deserve love exactly as you are. Please don’t measure your worth through someone else’s eyes. Your journey is yours — and that’s beautiful.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What future are you building now?</h2>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> I want to create more — music, films, opportunities — and continue using my platform to support mental health and kindness. That’s the legacy I hope to leave.</p>
