    <p><strong>Tom Holland</strong> has gone from a talented theatre kid to one of the most recognized faces in Hollywood. Yet despite global fame, his charm lies in how effortlessly down-to-earth he remains.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Tom, how has your life changed since becoming Spider-Man?</h2>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Hugely — but also not at all. I still feel like the same lad from Kingston who forgets where he put his keys. Spider-Man changed my career, but my family keeps my feet on the ground, even when the world expects me to fly.</p>

<h2>Q2 — You balance massive blockbusters with emotional indie roles. How do you choose characters?</h2>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> I choose stories that challenge me or make me uncomfortable. If it’s easy, I probably shouldn’t do it. Growth comes from stretching — physically, mentally, emotionally.</p>

<h2>Q3 — What’s the most surprising lesson fame has taught you?</h2>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> That privacy is gold. It’s okay to keep parts of yourself just for you and your loved ones. Boundaries aren’t walls — they’re protection for what matters most.</p>

<h2>Q4 — Your connection with younger fans is huge. What responsibility comes with that?</h2>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> It’s massive. Kids see Peter Parker in me, so I try to live up to that — kindness, resilience, and hope. I’m far from perfect, but every day I try a little better.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What dream do you still want to chase?</h2>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> To be a storyteller who surprises people. And maybe one day direct a film that makes someone in the audience say: “That changed me.”</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Tom Holland’s journey reminds us that the real superpower isn’t fame or strength — it’s humility. Staying true to who you are, even when the world crowns you a hero, is the greatest victory of all.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> You don’t have to wear a mask to be extraordinary — authenticity is your hero suit.</p>
