   <p><strong>Shah Rukh Khan</strong>, affectionately known as “King Khan”, has transcended cinema to become a global symbol of hope, romance, and resilience. In this exclusive interview, he talks about his origins, his philosophy of life, and the subtle power of gratitude.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You’ve come from modest beginnings to international stardom. How does that shape your view of success?</h2>
<p><strong>Shah Rukh:</strong> Success is relative. When I walk into a stadium where thousands shout my name, I still feel that boy from Delhi who first stood before a camera. That perspective keeps me grounded — every handshake, every smile, every performance matters.</p>

<h2>Q2 — Your fans call you “King” but you often call them your family. What’s your bond with them?</h2>
<p><strong>Shah Rukh:</strong> They are the reason my stories matter. Cinema is nothing without an audience. My heart beats for them. Their joy is my fuel, their tears my responsibility.</p>

<h2>Q3 — What drives you as an actor and a person today?</h2>
<p><strong>Shah Rukh:</strong> Curiosity and challenge. If I’m comfortable, I’m stagnant. I love pushing boundaries — theatre, films, production — all of it. But the core remains simple: authenticity.</p>

<h2>Q4 — You’ve worked across countries and cultures. How important is global cinema in today’s era?</h2>
<p><strong>Shah Rukh:</sharp> Cinema is the world’s mirror. If it reflects only one story, it fails. Diversity isn’t a trend — it’s the future. I’m proud to be part of films that bridge borders.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What message do you want to leave with the next generation?</h2>
<p><strong>Shah Rukh:</strong> Dream fearlessly. Work tirelessly. Love passionately. And always give back. Your story is your own — write it with integrity.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Shah Rukh Khan’s journey teaches us that true royalty isn’t in titles — it’s in humility, connection, and purpose. His life reminds us that fame doesn’t forge character — character shapes fame.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Your legacy is built in the moments you choose kindness over applause and meaning over comfort.</p>
