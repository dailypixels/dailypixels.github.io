    <p><strong>Barry Keoghan</strong> has rapidly emerged as one of cinema’s most compelling young actors, known for his intense performances, versatility, and unique presence. In this interview, he opens up about his craft, inspirations, and the journey that has shaped his career.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Your roles often feel transformative. How do you approach a new character?</h2>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> I immerse myself completely. Understanding the psychology, habits, and fears of the character is crucial. I try to live in their shoes without losing my own perspective — that balance makes it authentic.</p>

<h2>Q2 — Fame can be overwhelming. How do you stay grounded?</h2>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Staying close to family and friends keeps me real. I don’t chase the spotlight; I let my work speak. Quiet moments outside the industry are my anchor.</p>

<h2>Q3 — You’ve worked in independent films and blockbusters. How do you choose roles?</h2>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> I follow intuition. A role must challenge me, offer depth, and tell a story that matters. I love both indie intensity and mainstream storytelling — it’s the mix that keeps me engaged.</p>

<h2>Q4 — Mental health and creativity are intertwined. How do you nurture both?</h2>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Reflection and routine. Meditation, writing notes, and observing life help me process emotions. Creativity thrives when the mind is cared for, not just the craft.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What’s next for Barry Keoghan?</h2>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Expanding horizons — theatre, diverse film genres, and collaboration with visionary directors. I want to keep surprising myself and the audience.</p>
