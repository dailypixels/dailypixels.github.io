    <p><strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> has spent more than two decades shaping how billions communicate, share, and build community online. Yet as technology evolves, so does his mission: to ensure connection remains meaningful, ethical, and empowering for future generations. In this exclusive interview, Mark reveals his perspective on innovation, responsibility, and humanity in the age of AI.</p>

<h2>Q1 — You’ve grown from student entrepreneur to tech leader. What motivates you now?</h2>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> I started by wanting to help people stay connected. Today, I think bigger — how can technology give everyone a voice, support learning, and create opportunities? The mission evolved, but the heart is the same: connection should make life better.</p>

<h2>Q2 — AI is changing the world rapidly. How do you balance innovation with ethics?</h2>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Innovation without responsibility is dangerous. We focus on transparency, safety, and giving people control. AI should help creativity and productivity — not replace humanity. We’re constantly learning and improving.</p>

<h2>Q3 — The metaverse was a bold vision. How do you see its future now?</h2>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> The idea was always long-term. It's about presence — not just scrolling but actually <em>being</em> with others virtually. We’ve had progress and challenges, but the core goal remains: making digital experiences more human.</p>

<h2>Q4 — What does leadership mean to you today?</h2>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Listening. Accepting mistakes. Trusting talented people. Technology grows fast, but leadership requires patience and empathy. I try to keep learning from everyone around me — including critics.</p>

<h2>Q5 — How do you personally stay grounded amid global influence?</h2>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Family. My kids remind me of the future we’re building for. Long bike rides, reading, quiet time — those are my resets. It’s easy to get lost in the digital world, so real moments matter even more.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg’s story shows that power and responsibility must walk together. His vision continues to push boundaries — but with a growing awareness that connection must uplift humanity, not complicate it.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The future depends on tech leaders who remember the humans behind every screen — ensuring progress strengthens connection, compassion, and community.</p>
