    <p><strong>Babar Azam</strong> has become one of the finest batsmen of modern cricket, known for elegance, calmness, and unstoppable consistency. From a ball-picker in Lahore to a global cricket star, his rise reflects patience, belief, and endless hard work.</p>

<h2>Q1 — Your batting style is admired worldwide. What shaped your technique?</h2>
<p><strong>Babar:</strong> Hours and hours in the nets. I grew up watching heroes like Inzamam-ul-Haq and Virat Kohli—but my uncle Kamran Akmal pushed me harder than anyone. Discipline shaped my style.</p>

<h2>Q2 — How do you handle the pressure of expectations from millions?</h2>
<p><strong>Babar:</strong> Pressure is a privilege. When people expect from you, it means they believe in you. I stay focused—each ball, one step at a time.</p>

<h2>Q3 — What does leadership mean to you?</h2>
<p><strong>Babar:</strong> A leader is calm, even when the world is loud. It’s not just about runs—it’s about lifting the team, trusting your players, and believing till the last moment.</p>

<h2>Q4 — Critics come with fame. How do you stay grounded?</h2>
<p><strong>Babar:</strong> I look at where I started. I talk to family—they keep me real. At the end of the day, I’m still a student of the game.</p>

<h2>Q5 — What’s next for Babar Azam?</h2>
<p><strong>Babar:</strong> More growth. More milestones for Pakistan. I want young cricketers to believe that dreams come true through patience and faith.</p>
