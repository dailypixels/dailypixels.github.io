      <p>
        Urban street art transforms city streets into open-air galleries, blending creativity, culture, and social commentary. From murals to graffiti, street art gives voice to communities and artists while adding vibrancy to otherwise ordinary urban landscapes.
      </p>

      <h2>The Rise of Street Art</h2>
      <p>
        What started as underground graffiti movements has evolved into a global phenomenon. Cities worldwide celebrate street art as both artistic expression and cultural storytelling. Festivals, guided tours, and legal mural projects have helped integrate street art into urban culture.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Urban Art</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Murals:</strong> Large, detailed works that often carry social, political, or personal messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Graffiti:</strong> Colorful lettering and tagging that showcase individuality and style.</li>
        <li><strong>Stencil Art:</strong> Quick, reproducible designs that spread messages across walls.</li>
        <li><strong>Paste-Ups and Stickers:</strong> Smaller pieces that complement larger works.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Appreciating Street Art</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Look beyond aesthetics—consider the story, history, and message behind the artwork.</li>
        <li>Explore neighborhoods known for murals and street art culture.</li>
        <li>Attend festivals or exhibitions that showcase local artists.</li>
        <li>Document respectfully—avoid touching or damaging artwork.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Street Art and Community</h2>
      <p>
        Urban art often reflects the values, struggles, and dreams of communities. It can spark conversations, challenge norms, and create a sense of identity. By supporting local artists, communities enrich their cultural landscape and preserve artistic expression.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Street art is more than decoration—it’s a living, evolving dialogue between artists, communities, and passersby. Exploring urban murals and graffiti offers insight into cultural diversity, creativity, and the soul of a city.
