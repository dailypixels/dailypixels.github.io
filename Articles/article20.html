      <p>
        A decade ago, wearable technology was largely synonymous with fitness trackers—devices that counted steps and tracked heart rates. 
        Today, the industry has expanded dramatically, moving into healthcare, workplace safety, communication, and even fashion. 
        As innovation continues, wearables are poised to become an integral part of how we live, work, and interact.
      </p>

      <h2>From Fitness to Full Health Monitoring</h2>
      <p>
        Modern wearables now monitor blood oxygen, detect irregular heart rhythms, and even warn users about potential health risks before 
        symptoms appear. In the near future, wearable patches may monitor hydration levels or blood sugar in real time, helping people manage 
        chronic conditions more effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>Wearables at Work</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond personal health, industries are adopting wearable tech to improve workplace safety and productivity. 
        Construction workers use smart helmets that detect fatigue, while logistics employees wear devices that monitor posture to reduce injuries. 
        These innovations are not only improving safety but also reducing costs for employers.
      </p>

      <h2>Smart Fashion and Lifestyle</h2>
      <p>
        Wearable technology is also blending into fashion. Smart clothing can adjust temperature, monitor stress, or even generate energy. 
        Augmented reality (AR) glasses promise to overlay digital information onto the real world, reshaping how we navigate cities, 
        learn new skills, and connect with others.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy and Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        As with any technology that collects personal data, wearables raise concerns about privacy. 
        Who owns the information? How secure is it? Striking a balance between innovation and ethics will be essential for widespread trust and adoption.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>
        The next generation of wearables may go beyond external devices altogether, with implantable sensors or smart tattoos 
        that seamlessly integrate with our bodies. While these possibilities sound futuristic, many are already in development.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Wearable technology has evolved from a niche fitness trend into a rapidly expanding field with the power to transform healthcare, 
        workplaces, and daily living. As the line between humans and technology continues to blur, wearables may become as common—and as 
        essential—as smartphones are today.
