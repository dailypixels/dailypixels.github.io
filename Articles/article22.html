      <p>
        We often think of stress as something that only affects the mind—racing thoughts, worry, or irritability. 
        But the truth is, stress is not just “in your head.” The body and mind are deeply connected, 
        and chronic stress can leave very real marks on your physical health.
      </p>

      <h2>The Science of Stress</h2>
      <p>
        When you’re stressed, your body enters “fight-or-flight” mode, releasing hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. 
        This response is useful in short bursts, but when it happens too often, it can wear down your body. 
        Over time, this constant alertness weakens your systems and creates imbalances.
      </p>

      <h2>Physical Effects of Chronic Stress</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weakened Immunity:</strong> Stress lowers your body’s ability to fight off infections.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestive Issues:</strong> Anxiety and stress can trigger stomach aches, IBS, or acid reflux.</li>
        <li><strong>Heart Problems:</strong> High stress raises blood pressure and increases risk of heart disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Sleep:</strong> Stress disrupts the body’s natural sleep cycle, causing fatigue.</li>
        <li><strong>Muscle Tension:</strong> Constant stress leads to aches, headaches, and stiffness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Managing Stress for Better Health</h2>
      <p>
        The good news? You can protect your health by managing stress effectively. 
        Here are some proven methods:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice mindfulness or meditation daily.</li>
        <li>Get regular physical activity, even simple walks.</li>
        <li>Maintain healthy eating habits to support your body.</li>
        <li>Stay connected—talk to friends or family about worries.</li>
        <li>Prioritize sleep and relaxation as seriously as work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Stress Awareness Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Stress is a normal part of life, but ignoring it can lead to long-term harm. 
        By noticing early signs and making small lifestyle changes, 
        you can protect both your mental peace and physical health.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Your mind and body are not separate—they work as one. 
        Taking care of your mental health is also taking care of your physical health. 
        By managing stress, you’re giving yourself the chance to live a longer, healthier, and more balanced life.
