      <p>
        In our busy world, sleep often feels like a luxury we can cut back on. But science shows that 
        sleep isn’t just about rest—it’s the foundation of good health. 
        Without it, the body and mind can’t recharge, leading to stress, illness, and burnout. 
        Prioritizing quality sleep is one of the simplest yet most powerful ways to improve wellness.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Sleep Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Sleep is the body’s natural repair system. During deep sleep, tissues heal, the brain clears out toxins, 
        and memory gets consolidated. Without enough rest, both physical and mental health suffer. 
        Poor sleep has been linked to weakened immunity, anxiety, depression, weight gain, and reduced focus.
      </p>

      <h2>The Connection Between Sleep and Mental Health</h2>
      <p>
        Quality rest and mental well-being go hand in hand. Lack of sleep increases irritability, 
        lowers stress tolerance, and can even trigger anxiety disorders. On the flip side, consistent rest 
        boosts mood, sharpens decision-making, and helps maintain emotional balance.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Better Sleep</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set a Routine:</strong> Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily—even on weekends.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Screen Time:</strong> Blue light from phones and TVs can disrupt melatonin production.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a Sleep-Friendly Space:</strong> Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch Caffeine & Alcohol:</strong> Both can interfere with deep, restorative sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Relax Before Bed:</strong> Try light stretching, reading, or mindfulness meditation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Sleep is not wasted time—it’s an investment in health, happiness, and productivity. 
        By treating rest as a priority instead of an afterthought, we give ourselves the energy to live fully. 
        Remember: a well-rested you is a healthier, stronger, and more joyful you.
