    <main class="story-content">
      <p><em>Letters Never Sent</em> is an intimate family drama that unravels the weight of silence between a father and daughter who spent years apart.</p>

<p>The novel follows <strong>Amelia Hart</strong>, a young writer who returns home after her father’s sudden passing. While sorting through his belongings, she discovers a box hidden beneath the floorboards — filled with <strong>over 200 unsent letters</strong>.</p>

<h2>Who Were the Letters For?</h2>
<p>Every one of them… was written to her.</p>

<p>The letters reveal everything Amelia never knew:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Her father’s struggle with mental health</li>
  <li>Love he never knew how to show</li>
  <li>Regrets from moments he wasn’t there</li>
  <li>Memories he kept alive alone</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Emotional Core</h2>
<p>The book balances heartbreaking distance with the beauty of belonging found too late. The author writes with gentleness — honoring complicated love without blaming either side.</p>

<p>One line from a letter lingers: <br>
<em>“I didn’t know how to be the father you needed… but I tried to be the man you could forgive.”</em>
</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Grief is explored not just as loss — but as <strong>love with nowhere left to go</strong>. The novel encourages readers to say what matters while there’s still time.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p><em>Letters Never Sent</em> teaches that silence can be a prison, and connection is the escape. Sometimes the words we never say become the heaviest ones we carry.</p>
