    <main class="story-content">
      <p><strong>Blood Hackers</strong> is a pulse-pounding crime thriller where humanity’s desire to evolve is turned against itself.</p>

<p>In a near future where genetic upgrades are legal only for the rich, criminal syndicates emerge to “upgrade” anyone who can pay — or owes them.</p>

<p>The story follows <strong>Detective Rylan Voss</strong>, a former marine with a biotech heart implant that keeps him alive… and slowly kills his emotions.</p>

<h2>The Plot</h2>
<p>A series of brutal murders begin across the city. Victims are found missing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bone-reinforcement grafts</li>
  <li>Retinal night-vision implants</li>
  <li>Neuro-reflex boosters</li>
</ul>
<p>Their enhancements — harvested like luxury organs.</p>

<p>The prime suspect? A notorious upgrade surgeon called <strong>“The Mechanist”</strong>, who believes evolution should be earned through blood.</p>

<h2>What Makes It Terrifying</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Human bodies trafficked as high-value tech</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced criminals stronger than the police</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Implants that can override free will</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Turning Point</h2>
<p>Rylan learns that the murders connect to his own past — the upgrades in his chest came from someone who died to keep him alive. Guilt turns into obsession.</p>

<p>Inside an abandoned biotech facility, he confronts The Mechanist — discovering a horrifying truth:</p>
<p><em>The Mechanist needs Rylan’s heart to complete the “perfect soldier.”</em></p>

<p>The final fight is brutal, raw, and unforgettable — a battle not just for survival but for humanity’s future.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p><strong>How far would you go to become “better”?</strong> When evolution becomes transactional, morality mutates. The novel warns that the desire to improve ourselves can lead to losing what makes us human in the first place.</p>
