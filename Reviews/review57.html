     <p><em>Digital Detox Yoga</em> by wellness expert <strong>Aria Sullivan</strong> offers practical strategies to merge yoga, mindful breathing, and digital detox practices. It guides readers in reducing screen-induced stress while restoring energy, focus, and holistic wellness.</p>

<h2>Why Digital Detox Matters</h2>
<p>Sullivan highlights the cognitive and physical strain caused by prolonged screen exposure, including eye fatigue, poor posture, sleep disruption, and mental distraction. Integrating yoga with intentional tech breaks helps counter these effects and rebuild mental clarity.</p>

<h2>Yoga Practices for Digital Detox</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Breath-Focused Asanas:</strong> Simple postures emphasizing breath awareness to reduce stress and calm the nervous system.</li>
  <li><strong>Postural Alignment:</strong> Movements targeting shoulders, neck, and spine to correct digital posture strain.</li>
  <li><strong>Mindful Flow Sequences:</strong> Short sequences designed for screen breaks, promoting circulation and energy refresh.</li>
  <li><strong>Meditative Pauses:</strong> Guided micro-meditations to disengage from devices and restore focus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Integration into Daily Life</h2>
<p>The book encourages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>10‚Äì15 minute yoga breaks during workdays</li>
  <li>Evening routines to unwind and disconnect from screens</li>
  <li>Outdoor mindful yoga sessions to reconnect with nature</li>
  <li>Using yoga as a mindful transition between digital tasks</li>
</ul>
