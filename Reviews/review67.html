      <p><em>Cognitive Cities: How Smart Urban Tech Enhances Human Happiness</em> takes readers into a new era of smart cities — one where technology doesn’t just automate traffic or energy systems, but actively supports mental health, emotional wellbeing, and social connection.</p>

<h2>Concept Overview</h2>
<p>The book argues that cities produce “emotional environments” — and technology can be used to track, measure, and elevate collective happiness. Sensors, apps, and interactive design create communities that respond to human needs in real time.</p>

<h2>Key Innovations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Emotion-Aware Infrastructure:</strong> Public lighting adjusts to reduce anxiety and improve mood during night travel.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Social Maps:</strong> Apps connect lonely residents with local community activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Healthy Routing:</strong> Navigation that avoids pollution + promotes walkable nature paths.</li>
  <li><strong>Urban Biofeedback:</strong> Data on noise, stress, and movement improves planning decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Rest Zones:</strong> Serenity Pods with air purification + calming soundscapes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Urban stress is a rising public health challenge. By embedding wellbeing directly into a city’s technology, we build environments that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce social isolation</li>
  <li>Boost productivity and focus</li>
  <li>Support safer mobility</li>
  <li>Encourage healthier lifestyles</li>
  <li>Promote belonging and joy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expert Perspectives</h2>
<p>Architects, neuroscientists, and mental health advocates praise “Cognitive Cities” as a roadmap for a more compassionate smart future — technology as a partner in happiness, not a distraction from it.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p>The book emphasizes that smart cities should think like humans, not machines. Technology should elevate what makes cities alive: connection, creativity, and care.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The city of the future isn’t just intelligent — it’s emotionally intelligent.</p>
