     <p>Homework, tests, and grades have defined learning for over a century. But in a world where AI can solve equations faster than humans, schools are pivoting toward skills that can’t be automated: creativity, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving.</p>

<h2>What This Review Explores</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Skills over scores:</strong> Portfolios replacing report cards.</li>
  <li><strong>AI as a personal tutor:</strong> Customized learning paths for every student.</li>
  <li><strong>Experience-based credentials:</strong> Internships, workshops, and micro-learning badges.</li>
  <li><strong>Global classrooms:</strong> Students collaborating across countries and cultures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why the System Is Changing</h2>
<p>Employers care less about where you studied — and more about <strong>what you can make, solve, or build</strong>. The modern student isn’t preparing for exams; they’re preparing for industries still being invented.</p>

<h2>The New Pressure</h2>
<p>Without grades as a scoreboard, some students feel lost. Freedom demands self-direction — and not everyone is trained to lead themselves.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>
<p><em>Grade-Less</em> highlights a hopeful future: learning finally aligned with life. But it also warns that for education to evolve, support systems must evolve too — or the new era could widen the gap between the confident and the unsure.</p>
