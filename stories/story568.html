      <p>
        In a quiet city where the nights were dim and smog-heavy, lived Haroon, a painter forgotten by the world. His gallery had closed, his patrons vanished, but he still climbed his rooftop each night with canvas and brush.

      <p>
        One evening, as he dipped his brush in a jar of shimmering ink he’d found in an old market, something extraordinary happened: when he painted a star, it lifted off the canvas and into the sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, he thought it madness. But each stroke added a new star, glowing brighter than the ones lost to pollution. Soon, constellations he painted began to stretch across the heavens
      </p>

      <p>
        Neighbors noticed. Children whispered, “The stars are coming back.” Lovers walked hand in hand beneath skies reborn. The city, once cloaked in gray, began to shine again.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the ink was finite. Each night, the jar grew lighter. On the last drop, Haroon hesitated—paint for himself, or for the world?
      </p>

      <p>
        He painted one final star, larger than the rest, and inscribed it with his name. When it rose, brighter than any before, his rooftop was empty. Haroon was gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet above, his name gleamed, stitched into the heavens forever. The city never forgot him—the painter who returned the stars.
      </p>

      <p>
        This story reminds us that<b>art is a gift meant to outlive the artist.</b> Even when the creator fades, their light remains, guiding others in the dark.
