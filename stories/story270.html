      <p>Clara Bennett had always believed in closure. After she and Thomas left one another ten years ago, she buried the memory, moved to a new city, and built a life without him. Yet, on a snowy afternoon in November, a package arrived at her door, tied with a ribbon she recognized immediately. Inside were letters — one for each year they had been apart.</p>

<p>The first letter, penned in Thomas’s unmistakable handwriting, began simply: “Clara, I never stopped remembering.” She felt a pang of nostalgia and longing, the words unlocking emotions she had carefully locked away. Each letter spoke of a life lived apart, moments of joy, regrets, and quiet love that had persisted despite distance and time.</p>

<hr>

<p>Clara spent the following weeks reading each letter by candlelight, revisiting places in her mind where they had once shared laughter, tears, and dreams. Through his words, she discovered the life he had carved out — the victories, the heartbreaks, and the quiet longing for her that had never ceased. It was as if he had left a trail for her to follow back to him.</p>

<p>Finally, the last letter instructed her to meet him at the small park where they had first met, under the old oak tree that had witnessed their first kiss. Snow blanketed the ground, and Clara’s heart raced as she approached. There he was, older, more worn by life but undeniably him, waiting with an anxious smile.</p>

<p>“Clara,” Thomas whispered, voice trembling, “I’ve written every word because I needed you to know — you were never forgotten, never replaced.”</p>

<p>Tears blurred her vision, but she smiled through them. “I thought I had moved on,” she admitted. “But my heart knew differently.”</p>

<p>They embraced beneath the snow-laden branches, the past decade melting away. No words were needed; the letters had bridged the years, and the warmth of their shared memories ignited a new beginning. Together, they walked through the winter landscape, hearts aligned, ready to face the future hand in hand.</p>
