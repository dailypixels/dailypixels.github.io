      <p>The rain came down in quiet sheets as <strong>Hassan Malik</strong> set up his recorder on the scratched wooden desk of Station 91.3. The air smelled of dust, metal, and faint electricity — the scent of forgotten stories.</p>

<p>Across from him sat <strong>Farid Rahman</strong>, once the nation’s most beloved radio host — his voice had been the comfort of millions, his laughter the pulse of a generation. But tonight, he looked smaller, as though time itself had been whispering secrets into his bones.</p>

<p>“Mr. Farid, thank you for agreeing to this,” Hassan said softly, pressing record.</p>

<p>The old man smiled. “People stopped calling me ‘Mr.’ a long time ago. Just Farid is fine.”</p>

<p>For the first few minutes, they spoke about radio’s golden age — how it could paint worlds with nothing but sound. But when Hassan mentioned the last broadcast — the one that had cut off mid-sentence twenty years ago — the warmth left Farid’s eyes.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a technical failure,” Farid said quietly. “It was me. I stopped speaking.”</p>

<p>Hassan leaned in. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I realized I’d been lying,” Farid whispered. “Every night I told people to hold on, that everything would be alright. But that night, my daughter called the station — crying. I told her I was too busy to talk. The line went dead. So did she, an hour later.”</p>

<p>His voice cracked like static. “After that, every word felt dishonest.”</p>

<p>For a moment, all Hassan could hear was the rain against the glass — steady, relentless, forgiving.</p>

<p>“Then why speak now?” he asked gently.</p>

<p>Farid looked at the red <em>ON AIR</em> sign flickering above them. “Because silence is also a lie,” he said. “And I’ve been quiet long enough.”</p>

<p>He reached across the console and pushed the old broadcast button. A faint hum filled the room. Then, with a trembling breath, Farid said into the microphone:</p>

<p>“If anyone is listening — forgive the voices that went missing. Some of us needed to lose words to learn what they meant.”</p>

<p>Hassan sat frozen as the red light steadied — glowing brighter than it had in decades.</p>

<p>The next morning, the radio station played that recording on every frequency — one last time. And for the first time in years, people stopped scrolling, stopped rushing, and simply <em>listened</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
Words hold power, but silence carries truth.  
Farid reminds us that every story we tell — or avoid — shapes the sound of who we are.  
Some confessions don’t echo until the air itself is ready to listen.</p>
