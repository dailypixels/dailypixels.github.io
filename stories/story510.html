      <p>
        Every evening, elders of the village gathered beneath the great banyan tree. Its roots dangled like curtains, its shade like a roof of memory. Children sat cross-legged, waiting for stories that tied them to ancestors long gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some tales were warnings—about spirits that lived in the branches. Others were lessons—about honesty, courage, and humility. To the children, the banyan was not just a tree but a library of oral tradition.
      </p>

      <p>
        As years passed, television and phones distracted new generations. The banyan gatherings grew smaller. One evening, only a single elder arrived, carrying the weight of centuries in his voice. When he finished, he told the last child left: “The tree remembers, but it cannot speak without us. You must keep the voice alive.”
      </p>

      <p>
        That child grew up to record the stories and share them with the world. The banyan tree still stood, its silence heavy, but its roots now stretched far beyond the village through the power of words.
