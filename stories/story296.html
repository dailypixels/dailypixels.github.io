        The guns had fallen silent for only a few hours, but the mud of Verdun still trembled beneath the weight of war. Private Julien Mercier sat inside a dugout, his uniform soaked, his hands shaking as he held a small piece of paper — the last sheet he had left.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wrote by the dim light of a dying lantern, each stroke of his pen fighting against exhaustion. “My dearest Claire,” he began, “if this letter reaches you, know that I am thinking of the garden behind our house — of the lilacs you planted last spring. I can almost smell them, even here.” His words carried warmth into the cold, a fragile defiance against despair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside, the wind howled through the broken trenches, carrying the distant sound of artillery. Julien’s unit had been ordered to hold the line at dawn. He knew what that meant. Around him, the other soldiers slept fitfully, dreaming of home, of mothers and lovers and fields untouched by war.
      </p>

      <p>
        He folded the letter carefully, sealing it with a torn scrap of wax from a spent candle. Then he slipped it into his jacket pocket, over his heart. “I’ll deliver it myself,” he whispered with a faint smile. But fate had other plans.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the attack came at sunrise, the world turned to thunder and smoke. Julien charged with the others, through mud and shrapnel and fear. He fell near the ridge, the letter still pressed to his chest. The rain came soon after, washing the battlefield clean of names.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks later, a medic searching the dead found the letter. It was delivered, months after the war ended, to a small cottage in southern France. Claire Mercier wept as she unfolded the paper, her fingers trembling over the faded ink.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If I do not return,” it read near the end, “plant another lilac for me. Not in mourning — but in promise. So that when the world heals, there will be something beautiful to remind it of love that endured the darkest days.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Decades passed. The war became history, the names on the memorials blurred by time. But in a quiet garden in Provence, lilacs bloomed every spring — their fragrance drifting through the air like a whisper from another life.
