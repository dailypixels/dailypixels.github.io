    <main class="story-content">
      <p> Every night, I lit the lanterns of Eryndor. <br><br> From the highest tower to the narrowest street, I walked with a flame cupped in my hands — a keeper of light in a city that feared the dark. They called me *Lira of the Lanterns*, though no one ever remembered my face, only the glow that passed by their windows at dusk. </p> <p> Eryndor was a place built on light. Its towers gleamed with glass veins that pulsed softly at night, drawing their glow from the constellations above. But one evening, as I reached the northern gate, the stars began to vanish — one by one, like candles snuffed by an unseen hand. </p> <p> The sky turned silent. Then something fell — a single streak of fire across the horizon. It struck the ground near the old willow grove, and the earth trembled beneath my feet. I ran. Not out of duty, but instinct — as though the night itself had whispered my name. </p> <p> In the grove, I found it: A star no larger than my palm, pulsing like a heartbeat, its light soft and alive. It spoke — not in words, but in warmth. And when I touched it, the glow spread through me, filling every vein, every thought, every silence. For a moment, I was both human and horizon. </p> <p> The next morning, the city woke under gray skies. The stars were gone, and the lanterns no longer lit. The council panicked. They called it *The Eclipse of the Heavens.* Only I knew — one star still remained, hidden within me, burning quietly behind my ribs. </p> <p> I tried to return it. I climbed the high towers, the cliffs, even the Cloudspire Temple where sky-priests prayed for light. But each time, the star refused to leave. “You were chosen,” said the wind. “The sky does not reclaim what it gives.” </p> <p> As days passed, the city dimmed. Shadows grew like vines across the walls. People began to forget the color of dawn. I could not bear it — the world unlit, the children afraid. So I climbed the tower one last time and lifted my lantern high. <br><br> The star within me surged, and light burst outward — not from glass, but from my hands. The flame stretched across the horizon, weaving through clouds, rebuilding constellations one by one. </p> <p> Eryndor shone again. But I did not return to the streets. My body became light itself — scattered among the stars I had rekindled. They say that on clear nights, a single lantern glows brighter than the rest, wandering the edge of the sky. The people call it *Lira’s Lantern.* </p> <p> Sometimes, when the wind is kind, you can still hear my whisper: “Light is not meant to be kept — it is meant to be shared.” </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Lantern That Held the Sky* reminds us that the light we protect within ourselves can heal worlds beyond our sight. True magic is not about holding on — it’s about letting go, and trusting that what we give will continue to shine in others. <br><br> Even the smallest flame can rebuild the sky. 🌌 </p>
