      <p>
        When they were children, Sophie and Daniel spent every summer afternoon on the old wooden bridge outside their village. They carved their initials into the railing, told secrets, and made a solemn pact: “No matter what, we’ll always find our way back here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        But time, as it often does, scattered them. Sophie moved to the city for school. Daniel stayed, helping his family run the bakery. Calls became fewer, letters shorter, and eventually, silence filled the spaces where their laughter once lived.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, Sophie returned for her grandmother’s funeral. The town looked smaller, quieter. After the service, restless and heavy with grief, she wandered down to the river. The bridge was still there — older now, boards creaking, initials faded but still visible.
      </p>

      <p>
        And there, sitting on the railing with a fishing line in hand, was Daniel.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment, neither spoke. Then he grinned, just like the boy she remembered. “You’re late,” he said. “I’ve been waiting to cash in on that promise.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Sophie laughed through her tears, the sound startling in its familiarity. They sat side by side, feet dangling over the water, talking until the sun sank and the fireflies came out. She told him about the city, the loneliness hidden behind her successes. He told her about the bakery, the quiet joys, the quiet regrets.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Sophie admitted she was scared she’d lost too much time, Daniel shook his head. “Friendship isn’t about how often you talk. It’s about who you can come back to, no matter how long it’s been.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As the stars lit the sky, Sophie placed her hand over the faded initials carved years ago. “Then maybe this bridge still works both ways.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Daniel nodded. “It always did.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The river flowed beneath them, steady and timeless, carrying their laughter into the night.
      </p>

      <h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

      <p>
        True friendship doesn’t fade with distance or silence. It waits, like a bridge, ready to be crossed again when hearts are willing to return.
