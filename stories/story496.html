        The old woman kept a small jar on her kitchen shelf labeled *truth*. Neighbors laughed; secrets were normally kept under mattresses or behind curtains. But she simply smiled and stirred a grain of salt into every pot she made.
      </p>

        "Why salt?" the young neighbor asked once. The woman touched his hand and said, "Salt reminds you the world can be plain and still make sense. Take too much, and you spoil things. Too little, and it is all bland."
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, after storms and moves, the neighbor found himself teaching his own child to season soup, to taste and add a single grain at a time. He understood then that truth is like salt—small, precise, and most useful when you add it with care.
