      <p>
        Amira had always woken with the sense that her dreams slipped away too quickly. She would reach for them like water in her hands, only to find her palms empty by morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        One restless night, she followed a flicker of light outside her window. The moonlight led her to an alley she’d never noticed before, and at the end was a tall door carved with constellations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside lay the impossible: a library without end. Shelves spiraled upward into darkness, ladders floated mid-air, and the air hummed with whispers. Every book she opened revealed a dream—not her own, but those of strangers. A boy chasing a phoenix. A mother holding her child beneath a sky of falling stars. A king weeping in secret.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then she found a section marked Unclaimed. There, the books glowed faintly, waiting. She opened one and gasped. It was hers. A dream from childhood she thought long forgotten—a meadow of golden grass, where her late father waited and told her she was brave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tears welled. She spent hours—maybe days—wandering, finding pieces of herself she never knew she’d lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        A librarian appeared at last, cloaked in starlight. “Dreams live even when you forget them,” he said gently. “But they wait for you to return.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When Amira left, dawn was breaking. She carried no books, but inside her, the meadow remained alive. And from then on, when she dreamed, she no longer feared forgetting—because she knew where they would be kept.
      </p>

        Meaning / Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        The story reminds us that even when memories fade,<b> what we dream, feel, and love is never truly lost</b>. They live within us, waiting for the moment we are ready to reclaim them.
