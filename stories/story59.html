    <main class="story-content">
      <p>
        When we were twelve, Mark and I built a bridge.  
        Not a real one — just wooden planks nailed together  
        across the creek that split our neighborhood.  
        It was uneven, wobbly, and half the time  
        it sank in the mud.  
      </p>

      <p>
        But to us, it was a masterpiece.  
        That bridge was the shortcut to adventures:  
        summer afternoons catching fireflies,  
        daring each other to jump into the cold water,  
        and long talks about dreams we couldn’t name yet.  
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time high school came,  
        the bridge had rotted away.  
        So had some of our closeness.  
        Mark joined the football team,  
        I buried myself in books.  
        We still nodded in the halls,  
        but our worlds began drifting apart.  
      </p>

      <p>
        After graduation, he left town.  
        I stayed.  
        Life moved forward — college, work,  
        a family of my own.  
        Years passed without a single word between us.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Then last year, I got a call.  
        A shaky voice I hadn’t heard in decades.  
        “It’s Mark. I’m… back home.  
        Could we meet?”  
      </p>

      <p>
        I almost said no.  
        But curiosity tugged harder than pride.  
        So we met — at the creek.  
        The same place, only now overgrown,  
        the old boards long gone.  
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked older, worn down by life.  
        “I shouldn’t have disappeared,” he admitted.  
        “I kept meaning to call…  
        but every year it got harder.  
        And then I figured… maybe you’d moved on.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        We stood there in silence,  
        the ghosts of our younger selves watching.  
        Finally, I said:  
        “Let’s build another one.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        And we did.  
        Not with perfect wood or steady hands.  
        Just two middle-aged men,  
        hammering and laughing,  
        sometimes pausing to wipe our eyes.  
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of the day,  
        a new bridge stood across the creek.  
        Stronger than the last.  
        A little crooked, maybe — but solid.  
      </p>

      <p>
        And as we sat side by side,  
        watching the sunset reflect in the water,  
        I realized something.  
        That bridge wasn’t just wood and nails.  
        It was forgiveness.  
        It was time, rewoven.  
        It was friendship, rediscovered.
