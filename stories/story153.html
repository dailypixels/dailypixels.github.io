      <p><strong>Part I: The Frontline</strong></p>

<p>The mud of Verdun clung to everything — boots, rifles, even hope. Étienne Morel hadn’t seen a clean sky in weeks. Smoke and thunder rolled across the horizon as shells screamed above. The earth shook like a living thing. Every breath smelled of metal and fear.</p>

<p>In the dim trench light, he took out a small scrap of paper and began to write. His hands trembled from exhaustion, but his words were steady.</p>

<p><em>“My dearest Claire,</em><br>
<em>If this letter reaches you, know that I think of you with every sunrise I still see. They say we fight for France — but I fight for the sound of your laughter, for the life we dreamed by the river.”</em></p>

<p>He paused, hearing a whistle — the warning of another incoming barrage. The world above exploded in fire and soil. Étienne ducked, heart hammering, before returning to the paper. Around him, men shouted, prayed, cursed. But in his words, there was only peace.</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The Promise</strong></p>

<p>Night fell, cold and wet. Étienne shared what little wine he had with a fellow soldier, Julien. “You still writing to her?” Julien asked, trying to smile through cracked lips.</p>

<p>Étienne nodded. “She’s the reason I’m still standing.”</p>

<p>Julien stared at the stars — faint pinpricks through smoke. “Then keep writing. Someone should remember us when this madness ends.”</p>

<p>The next morning, Étienne’s regiment was ordered to advance. The ground ahead was a graveyard of craters. He tucked the letter into his coat pocket and whispered, “For her.”</p>

<p>He never returned.</p>

<p><strong>Part III: The Discovery</strong></p>

<p>In 1920, five years after the Armistice, a group of workers clearing the ruins near Verdun unearthed a rusted tin box. Inside was a folded letter, still sealed, its edges blackened but legible. It was sent to the town of Reims, to one Claire Morel.</p>

<p>She was an old woman by then, hair silver, eyes dim with memory. When the postman placed the envelope in her hands, her breath caught. She opened it slowly, as if afraid the air might steal the words away.</p>

<p><em>“...If I cannot return, promise me you’ll keep living. Plant the apple tree by the river like we dreamed. One day, when it blooms, you’ll know I kept my promise — that I loved you until the last.”</em></p>

<p>Tears blurred the ink, but she read it again and again, until she could recite every word by heart. That spring, she planted the tree beside the river — alone, but smiling through her grief.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Legacy</strong></p>

<p>A century later, in 2025, the apple tree still stood. Its blossoms drifted across the quiet banks of the Marne like pink snow. A young girl named Elise — Claire’s great-granddaughter — sat beneath it with her notebook, tracing the old letter framed on the wall at home.</p>

<p>She was writing her own story now, one about courage and love that endured beyond war. When she looked up, a petal landed on her page. For a moment, she thought she could hear distant whispers — a promise carried through time.</p>

<p>“Keep living,” it seemed to say.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Letter from Verdun</em> reminds us that love often outlives war, distance, and even death. It speaks of the small acts — a letter, a seed, a memory — that allow humanity to endure even when the world breaks around it. 🌸✉️</p>
