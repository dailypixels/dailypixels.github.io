     <p> The night the stars went out, the world didn’t notice at first. <br><br> Clouds covered the sky, and everyone assumed the storm would pass. But when dawn came and the sky remained gray — blank and hollow — the world fell silent. </p> <p> In the coastal town of Mirae, a young mapmaker named <strong>Elara</strong> looked up and felt something tear inside her. Her maps depended on the constellations — her dreams did too. She had charted every known land, but now there was nothing left to guide her. </p> <p> That night, while she sat among her unfinished charts, an old man entered her shop. His cloak shimmered faintly, as though dusted with moonlight. He placed a small brass lantern on her table — its flame faint but steady. <br> “This is the last light of the Lost Sky,” he said. “If you wish to see the stars again, you must return this to its home.” <br> Before she could ask more, he vanished, leaving behind only the faint scent of rain. </p> <p> Elara followed the faint glow of the lantern across deserts of glass, through forests where trees whispered names she didn’t know, and over mountains where time moved slower than breath. <br> Each night, she placed the lantern before her and drew maps of places no one had seen before — hoping the light would remember the sky it came from. </p> <p> In the frozen plains of Auryn, she met a boy who spoke to echoes. He told her of a gate made of crystal that opened to the firmament itself. “But it opens only for those who carry both light and longing,” he said. <br> She carried both. </p> <p> They traveled together until the horizon split open with storm and flame. The boy was lost to the wind, and Elara, clutching the lantern, reached the crystal gate alone. <br> The sky above was a vast emptiness — no moon, no stars, only reflection. She lifted the lantern high. <br> “You were made from what we lost,” she whispered. “Now go home.” </p> <p> The flame rose, spiraling upward until it broke into countless fragments — each one a star reborn. <br> Light spilled across the void, filling every shadow, every map, every memory. <br> When Elara opened her eyes, she stood on a bridge made of starlight — the same bridge that connected every dreamer to the sky. </p> <p> She smiled through her tears. Her maps would never be complete now — because the world had no end, only light waiting to be found. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Lantern of the Lost Sky* reminds us that discovery begins when guidance ends. Even in the absence of light, those who continue to walk — with courage, wonder, and longing — become the very stars they seek. ✨ </p>
