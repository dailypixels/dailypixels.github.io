      <p>
        On the steps of the abandoned post office, Sana found a bundle of letters tied with twine, soaked from the rain. Curiosity drew her to read the first page: they were love letters, written by a man named Kamran to a woman named Hira, dated fifty years ago.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Each letter told of longing, distance, and promises of reunion. Yet the last few grew darker—Kamran had been drafted for war, and his words became filled with fear. The final letter ended abruptly, ink smudged mid-sentence.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Sana searched the city archives, discovering Kamran had never returned. Hira had lived her life alone, working in a nearby bakery until her death. The letters were never delivered; they remained sealed in the post office during the fire that closed it down decades earlier.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing under the rain, Sana wept—not for strangers she never knew, but for the story that had been left unfinished. She decided to publish their letters in a local paper, ensuring their voices were no longer lost to time.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Love, she realized, doesn’t only live in those who receive it. Sometimes it belongs to the world, whispering across decades, teaching others about longing and resilience.
