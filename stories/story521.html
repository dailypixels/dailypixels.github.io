        Aisha had always seen airports as liminal spaces, where people existed between worlds. She was en route to Paris for a new job when her flight was delayed overnight. Wandering through the near-empty terminal, she noticed a man sketching in a notebook near Gate 12.
      </p>

      <p>
        His name was Omar, an architect returning home after a failed project abroad. They began to talk—about cities, about ambition, about mistakes that reshape dreams. The hours slipped by like minutes. 
      </p>

      <p>
        When the announcement finally called her boarding, Aisha hesitated. Omar smiled softly: “Sometimes delays aren’t accidents. They’re invitations.” She laughed, but the words lingered as she walked toward her gate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, Aisha built a career in Europe, but she often returned to that night in the terminal. It reminded her that not every missed connection was truly lost—some became part of the story you carried forward, shaping who you were in quiet ways.
