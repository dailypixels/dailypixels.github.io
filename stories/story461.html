      <p>
        Rafiq had returned to his old neighborhood with a quiet bag of seeds and a heavier heart. Years away had left him feeling like a stranger: a father who’d missed birthdays, a friend who’d missed time, a son who’d missed apologies. The empty lot at the corner — once a playground — looked at him like a question waiting to be answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        He proposed a simple idea at the community meeting: turn the lot into a garden. Some scoffed — "Who has time?" others shrugged — "It’s been nothing for years." But a few remembered him differently: how he once taught neighborhood kids to fix bicycles, how he’d once spared a smile for anyone who needed it. They agreed, tentatively, to try.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first morning, they arrived with shovels, paint, and nervous hope. Neighbors who had avoided each other for a decade found themselves kneeling side by side, learning the names of herbs and the patience of soil. Children planted with laughter that felt like rain after drought. Old arguments dissolved when someone offered another cup of tea.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rafiq worked until his hands ached. He apologized to those he had disappointed, not with speeches but with steady presence — showing up to water when it was dry, to repair a trellis when it bent. Slowly, the garden grew: mint, tomatoes, a small quince tree that would one day bear fruit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Months later, the garden hosted a small festival. People brought flatbreads, songs, and stories. A child gave Rafiq a painted sign: "Second Chances Grow Here." He stood under the quince tree and felt, for the first time in years, the lightness of being forgiven and the quiet power of rebuilding with others.
      </p>

      <p>
        The garden taught the neighborhood — and Rafiq — that repair is a daily act. Forgiveness is not a single moment but a series of small, faithful choices. In the green rows they had created, everyone planted something important: hope, work, and the courage to begin again.
