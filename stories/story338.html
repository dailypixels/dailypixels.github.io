      <p>
        Miguel planted a lemon tree the day his daughter was born. Through storms and neglect, the tree survived, growing taller as she grew.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she left for college, Miguel felt the emptiness in his backyard. That spring, the tree blossomed for the first time. He realized life was still moving, still fruitful.
      </p>

      <p>
        When his daughter returned, they laughed at the crooked lemons and turned them into sweet-tart lemonade together. It became their ritual—a reminder that life, though bitter at times, is always worth savoring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Growth takes time, storms pass, and love endures—just like the little lemon tree.
