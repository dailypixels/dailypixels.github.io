      <p>
        Detective Lena arrived at the old hotel to investigate a series of strange disappearances. Guests had reported a room that seemed to vanish from the floor plan, appearing only to trap those who entered.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, she found the door: plain, unmarked, almost invisible. Curiosity and duty compelled her inside. The room was small, perfectly furnished, yet eerily quiet. When she tried to leave, the door had vanished.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, Lena discovered photographs and belongings of missing guests. Her own badge rested on a desk she didn’t recognize. A voice echoed, “Some rooms aren’t meant to be left, only remembered.”  
        Panic rose as the walls seemed to shift, elongate, and twist, disorienting her completely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours—or maybe days—later, Lena awoke outside the hotel, clutching the same room key she had found. The hallway had returned, but the guests were gone, leaving only their whispers in the shadows.  
        She realized the hotel didn’t just trap bodies—it trapped perception, bending reality for anyone who dared to uncover its secret.
