    <main class="story-content">
      <p>The valley of Elyndra was a place the world had forgotten — a land where the night itself breathed softly and every breeze whispered the stories of the stars. In its heart stood a bridge of white stone stretching across a mist-shrouded lake. There, upon the bridge, stood the Lantern Keeper.</p>

<p>Her name was Ilyra, though few remembered it. For generations, her duty had been to tend the <em>Lanterns of Souls</em> — floating lights that drifted across the lake’s surface like golden stars fallen from the sky. Each lantern held the life essence of a person: their joys, memories, regrets, and final breath. When one went out, the soul was said to rest forever in the Light Beyond.</p>

<p>Every evening, Ilyra would walk the bridge with her staff of crystal and light the lanterns that flickered weakly. She did this with care, humming an old melody that only the stars remembered. Her song was said to soothe restless spirits.</p>

<p>But one night, she noticed something strange — a single lantern glowing brighter than any she had ever seen. Its flame was not gold, but white, pure and unwavering. The inscription beneath it read only one word: <strong>Cael</strong>.</p>

<p>She opened the record scrolls, searching for the name. The soul of Cael had been extinguished over two hundred years ago. Yet his lantern burned, defying death itself.</p>

<p>“Impossible,” whispered Ilyra. “All lights fade.”</p>

<p>That night, sleep would not come. The white lantern called to her, its light dancing across the mist, pulling her toward the edge of the lake. As her hand brushed its surface, the water rippled — and the world shifted.</p>

<p>She found herself standing in a field of silver grass under a violet sky. Before her stood a man with eyes like dawn and a faint, knowing smile. He was dressed in the garb of an ancient knight, the emblem of Elyndra’s first guardians upon his chest.</p>

<p>“You kept my light alive,” he said softly. “Why?”</p>

<p>Ilyra bowed. “Because it refused to die.”</p>

<p>Cael nodded. “Then you have defied the Law of the Lanterns. Those who keep light from fading also keep sorrow from resting.”</p>

<p>She hesitated. “But this light... it feels different. Warm. Eternal.”</p>

<p>“It is,” he said, stepping closer. “It is not my soul — it is hope itself. When I fell in the War of Shadows, I gave my last breath not to live again, but to light a flame that would never go out. A flame for all who come after.”</p>

<p>The violet sky trembled. The lake beyond began to dissolve. “The lanterns are fading,” she said. “All of them!”</p>

<p>Cael’s form began to shimmer. “Elyndra is ending, Keeper. The world of spirits must pass so the world of the living may dream again. You must choose — stay, and fade with your lights, or return and carry this one flame to the waking world.”</p>

<p>Ilyra clutched the glowing lantern. The bridge, the water, the sky — all melted into light. She whispered, “Then let this light belong to them.”</p>

<p>When dawn broke over the mortal world, a single lantern was seen drifting through the mist of the valley. Inside, its flame burned brighter than the sun. Villagers found it upon the shore, and for the first time in centuries, they spoke the Keeper’s name.</p>

<p>Legends say that from that day forward, no night in Elyndra was ever truly dark again. And somewhere among the stars, Ilyra’s song still lingers — the melody of one who kept hope alive.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Lantern Keeper of Elyndra</em> is a tale about the endurance of hope — a light that survives even when everything else fades. It reminds us that every act of kindness, every spark of love, is a flame worth keeping, for it might be the one that guides others through the dark. 🌙✨</p>
