     <p><strong>Part I: The Lantern at Dawn</strong></p>

<p>Every morning, before the sun touched the horizon, Elias Ward walked to the end of the old pier with his lantern. The wooden planks groaned beneath his boots, the sea whispering against the pilings below. He’d been doing it for thirty years — lighting that same iron lantern and hanging it from the hook at the pier’s edge.</p>

<p>Locals called him “The Lantern Keeper.” No one quite knew why he did it. The lighthouse had long since gone automated; ships no longer sailed close to the rocky coast. Yet Elias came without fail, rain or shine, dawn or storm, and left that small golden flame burning against the gray sea.</p>

<p>“Old habit,” he would say whenever asked. “Light’s meant to be shared.”</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The Boy and the Storm</strong></p>

<p>One autumn morning, a young boy named Leo sat watching from the dunes. He had moved to the seaside town recently and had grown curious about the old man who seemed to live by the tide’s rhythm. That morning, clouds rolled heavy and dark, the kind that promised thunder. Yet Elias was there — lighting his lantern, steady and calm.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t be out here!” Leo called. “There’s a storm coming.”</p>

<p>Elias smiled without turning. “Aye, but storms need light too.”</p>

<p>That night, the wind howled and waves crashed over the breakwater. From his bedroom window, Leo saw the pier swallowed by rain — but still, through the storm, the faint glow of a single lantern swayed in the distance. He fell asleep watching it, the light blinking like a heartbeat in the dark.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part III: The Story of the Light</strong></p>

<p>The next morning, Leo ran to the pier. Elias was there again, sitting on an overturned crate, polishing the glass of his lantern.</p>

<p>“Why do you keep lighting it?” the boy asked. “Nobody comes here anymore.”</p>

<p>The old man looked at him for a long time, then nodded toward the sea. “Once, a ship went down out there — long before your time. My brother was on it. I was the one supposed to light the lantern that night.”</p>

<p>Leo’s eyes widened. “You mean… you forgot?”</p>

<p>“No,” Elias said softly. “The storm came early. By the time I reached the pier, it was too late. I found the wreckage at dawn.” He ran his thumb over the lamp’s metal rim. “So now I light it for him — and for anyone else still lost out there. Not because they can see it, but because I can.”</p>

<p>He smiled faintly. “Keeps me human.”</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Day the Light Went Out</strong></p>

<p>Winter came harsh and unforgiving. One morning, Leo waited by the dunes — but the old man didn’t appear. The pier was empty. The sea gray and still.</p>

<p>By sunset, townsfolk gathered at Elias’s small cottage. He had passed peacefully in his sleep, the lantern on his table still half-filled with oil. Leo stood quietly among them, tears stinging his eyes.</p>

<p>That night, the pier was dark for the first time in thirty years. And yet — as the boy walked home, something in him couldn’t stand it. He ran back to the cottage, took the lantern, filled it with oil, and carried it through the cold wind to the edge of the pier.</p>

<p>When he lit it, the flame danced wildly — as if greeting an old friend.</p>

<p>“Light’s meant to be shared,” he whispered.</p>

<p>And from that night on, the lantern never missed a dawn.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Lantern Keeper</em> is a story about quiet devotion — the kind of goodness that doesn’t seek recognition, only purpose. It reminds us that hope is a light we must tend even when no one is watching. Because sometimes, the flame we keep alive for others becomes the one that saves us too. 🌅🕯️</p>
