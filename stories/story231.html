    <main class="story-content">
      <p>Clara Whitmore never liked mirrors. Even as a child, she’d cover them before sleeping, whispering that they “watched too much.” Her grandmother used to laugh it off — until the night she, too, started covering every reflective surface in the old Whitmore mansion.</p>

<p>When Clara inherited the estate in 2025, the house had been untouched for years. Dust covered the furniture, the air thick with the scent of old wood and lavender. But in the parlor stood one object her grandmother could never bear to remove — a tall, antique mirror framed in silver vines, its glass cracked in one corner like a spider’s web.</p>

<p>On her first night there, Clara walked past it and froze. Her reflection looked... wrong. The lighting was dim, but she could swear her reflection smiled a second too late. She blinked. The reflection didn’t.</p>

<p>“It’s just the old glass,” she whispered to herself. “Distortion.”</p>

<p>But the next morning, the mirror was uncovered again — though she distinctly remembered draping a cloth over it before bed. And in the reflection, the crack had grown longer.</p>

<p>By the third night, she started hearing whispers. Not from outside — from within the mirror. Words too faint to decipher, like echoes bouncing through water. She pressed her hand to the glass and felt something warm — a heartbeat.</p>

<p>Panicking, Clara called the local antiques expert, Mr. Lorne, who arrived two days later. He examined the frame carefully. “This isn’t a mirror,” he said slowly. “It’s a Venetian looking glass. They were rumored to be made with a second layer — silver mixed with... something else. People said they could trap what the eye can’t see.”</p>

<p>That night, Clara couldn’t sleep. The mirror was calling her name now, soft but insistent. <em>Clara... come closer...</em> She stood before it in her nightgown, heart racing. The reflection smiled again, but this time — it raised its hand before she did.</p>

<p>She stumbled back, the floorboards creaking underfoot. “Who are you?” she whispered.</p>

<p>The reflection tilted its head. Its lips moved slowly: <em>“You’re me.”</em></p>

<p>Terrified, Clara grabbed a bedsheet to cover the glass — but the reflection reached out from within, fingers pressing against the inside of the surface. The sheet fell. The reflection’s eyes glowed faintly, and her own body went rigid. She tried to move — but couldn’t.</p>

<p>When she woke the next morning, the sunlight poured through the window. The house was quiet. Too quiet.</p>

<p>She went to make tea, but when she passed by the hallway mirror, she froze again. The woman reflected there looked like her — same face, same clothes — but the eyes were different. Colder. Watching.</p>

<p>Weeks passed. Visitors said Clara seemed “changed.” Her laugh had lost its warmth. Her movements were deliberate, as though she were learning how to move in her own skin.</p>

<p>One day, Mr. Lorne returned to check on her. When he entered the parlor, he found the mirror perfectly clean — no cracks, no dust. Clara stood before it, smiling.</p>

<p>“You fixed it,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied softly, voice calm and steady. “It’s all clear now.”</p>

<p>But as he turned to leave, something caught his eye — the reflection. It was smiling still... even after Clara stopped.</p>

<p>Later that night, the villagers saw the light in the mansion flicker out. The next morning, the house stood empty. But if anyone stepped too close to the parlor mirror, they could swear they saw movement behind the glass — a woman pounding silently, trying to get out.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Face in the Mirror</em> explores how identity can become a prison when we lose control of who we truly are. The mirror is not just a symbol of vanity or fear — it’s a reminder that the darkest reflection we face might not come from the glass, but from within ourselves. 🪞💀</p>
