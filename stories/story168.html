      <p>
        Ella and Ryan had grown up in the same neighborhood, inseparable since kindergarten. Their friendship had always been a source of strength, laughter, and unwavering support.
      </p>

      <p>
        One summer, Ella faced a major career setback that left her doubting her abilities. Feeling lost, she called Ryan, who immediately dropped everything to be by her side.  
        Together, they planned new strategies, brainstormed ideas, and reminded each other of past victories.
      </p>

      <p>
        During a weekend hike, they came across a rickety rope bridge over a deep gorge. Ella hesitated, fear gripping her, but Ryan held out his hand. “I’ll be with you every step,” he said.  
        Step by step, Ella crossed the bridge, her confidence growing with every careful movement.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bridge became a symbol of their friendship: trust, courage, and unwavering support. Ella realized that challenges were easier to face when someone truly believed in her. Ryan, in turn, found joy in helping his friend rediscover her inner strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        That evening, standing on the other side of the gorge, they laughed, hugged, and promised to always be the bridge for each other in life’s trials and triumphs.
