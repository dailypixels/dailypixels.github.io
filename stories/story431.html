      <p>
        In the attic of a crumbling house on the edge of the old quarter, an object remained untouched: a rusted lantern, its glass cracked, yet still glowing faintly at dusk. Neighbors whispered that it had been burning for over a century, never dimming, never extinguishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amal, a young historian, dismissed the tale as superstition—until she found herself standing in the attic, staring at the eerie light. The flame wavered not with wind, nor with breath, but pulsed like a heartbeat. Inside the base, she discovered etched names—hundreds of them—spanning generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        She traced her finger over the last name, half-carved, unfinished: <em>Amal…</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Her hands trembled. The lantern’s glow swelled brighter, casting shadows that seemed to lean closer. Was it memory? A curse? A warning? She backed away, yet the attic seemed to shrink around her. The lantern burned on, as though waiting for her to decide whether she would finish carving her name—or flee and let the legend claim another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside, the house loomed silent, its attic window flickering with that same forgotten light, seen only by those who dared to look too long.
