      <p>
        Investigative journalist Claire checked into the old Marlowe Hotel to cover its rumored disappearances.  
        Guests spoke of a mysterious room that seemed to vanish and reappear, swallowing whoever entered.

        As Claire explored the dimly lit corridors, the air grew colder, and shadows seemed to twist unnaturally.  
        She noticed a door with no room number, slightly ajar, emanating a faint humming sound.
      </p>

        Gathering courage, Claire stepped inside. The room appeared normal at first—furnished, warm, and quiet—but as she turned, the door vanished behind her.  
        Her phone showed no signal, and the windows reflected only an endless hallway.
      </p>

        Hours passed—or maybe minutes. A whisper led her to a hidden switch, revealing a secret passage and a journal describing the disappearances.  
        To her shock, the last entry bore her name and arrival date—someone had predicted her presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Claire escaped the room just as a hotel employee appeared, smiling unnervingly.  
        “You found it,” he said, “but only because it wanted you to.”  
        As she left the hotel, she realized the Marlowe Hotel was alive in ways no one could explain, and some mysteries are never truly solved.
