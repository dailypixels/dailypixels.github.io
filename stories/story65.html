      <p>
        Detective Aaron Keller had investigated dozens of crimes,  
        but none as strange as the house on Ravenhill Street.  
        The neighbors swore they heard voices from inside,  
        though the property had been abandoned for over twenty years.
      </p>

      <p>
        The front door was chained shut, but one upstairs window  
        glowed faintly at night.  
        Aaron forced entry, his flashlight sweeping across dust and cobwebs.  
        Everything was silent—too silent.  
        Until he reached the locked room at the end of the hall.
      </p>

      <p>
        The door was heavy oak, bolted from the outside.  
        A metallic scratching echoed from within.  
        “Hello?” Aaron called, his voice steady though his heart raced.  
        No reply, just the slow drag of something sharp on wood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Against his better judgment, he slid the bolt open.  
        The door creaked.  
        Inside was a bare room, empty except for a chair in the center.  
        On the chair sat a recorder, still running,  
        its tape wheels spinning endlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        He pressed play.  
        A voice filled the room—his own voice.  
        “If you’re hearing this,” it said, “you’ve already let it out.”  
        The tape hissed, and the scratching grew louder… this time, behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aaron spun around, flashlight shaking.  
        The hallway he had entered from was gone.  
        Only another door stood there—bolted, from the inside.  
        And as his own recorded laughter echoed through the walls,  
        the light from his torch flickered and died.
