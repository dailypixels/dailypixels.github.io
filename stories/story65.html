      <p> They called him *Mad Arlen* — the man who planted trees in a desert. The valley of *Drymarch* hadn’t seen rain in six years, and nothing but dust grew there. Villages had emptied, rivers had gone silent, and wind carved the earth into deep, cracked scars. </p> <p> But every morning, as the sun rose, Arlen walked to the barren edge of the valley carrying a wooden bucket and a handful of seeds. He would kneel, press his fingers into the dry soil, and whisper, “Someday, you’ll remember how to live.” Then he’d plant one seed, pour a single cup of water, and move to the next patch of earth. </p> <p> The townspeople laughed at him. “You can’t grow a forest in a grave,” they said. “The world is done with this place.” But Arlen didn’t argue. He just smiled, brushed the dust off his hands, and returned the next day — and the next — for years. </p>
<p><strong>The First Year — Dust</strong>
<p> The first year, nothing grew. The winds were cruel, and the sun never blinked. Arlen’s skin cracked, his hands bled, and still, he planted. He lived in a small shack made of scrap wood and old tin, feeding on whatever roots or rainwater he could find. When asked why he didn’t leave, he said simply, *“Because something still can.”* </p> <p> At night, he’d sit by a small oil lamp, counting his seeds like prayers. To him, each one was not a possibility — it was a promise. </p>
<p><strong>The Fifth Year — The First Green</strong>
<p> It was on a morning after a rare storm that Arlen saw it — a tiny sprout pushing through the dirt near his doorstep. He fell to his knees and wept, his tears mingling with the damp soil. He guarded that sprout like it was a child, shading it from the harsh wind with his own body. </p> <p> More shoots followed. Not many, just a handful — but enough to whisper that he was not entirely alone in his faith. The villagers began to watch from a distance. Some shook their heads; others fell quiet. A few children, curious, started visiting him, asking, “Why do you care so much?” Arlen smiled and replied, *“Because one day, you will.”* </p>
<p><strong>The Twentieth Year — The Grove of Tomorrow</strong>
<p> By the time Arlen turned seventy, the desert had changed. A thin green scar now stretched across the valley — a line of life cutting through the dust. Birds had begun to return. Rain fell twice that year. The earth remembered its own heartbeat. </p> <p> A traveler passing through wrote about him in a newspaper: *“The Old Man of Drymarch: The One Who Grew a Forest Alone.”* Soon, others came — scientists, farmers, dreamers. They brought seeds, water, and hands willing to work. Arlen didn’t seek fame or help, but when they came, he smiled and said, “The desert needed all of us.” </p> <p> He never stopped planting. Even when his hands trembled, even when he couldn’t walk far, he would sit near the grove and push seeds into the ground with his fingertips. “The trees will take it from here,” he’d whisper. </p>
<p><strong>The Last Day — A New Dawn</strong>
<p> When Arlen passed away, the valley bloomed. His small hut became a place of pilgrimage — not for religion, but for remembrance. Every tree that grew from his hands now stood tall, bending toward the light he never stopped believing in. The children who once watched him with wonder now brought their own children to plant beside his forest. </p> <p> On his gravestone, someone carved a single line: <br><em>“He planted what he would never see — and saw what he had always believed.”</em></p> <p> A hundred years later, when travelers cross the land once called *Drymarch*, they walk under cool shade and whisper of the man who turned dust into dawn. And though no one alive remembers his face, everyone breathes the proof of his faith. </p>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Man Who Planted Tomorrow* reminds us that greatness is not measured by recognition, but by quiet persistence. Real change takes time — sometimes a lifetime — but every seed planted in faith, every act done without applause, carries the power to reshape the world. What we begin may not bloom in our time, but it will in someone’s tomorrow. 🌱☀️ </p>
