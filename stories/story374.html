      <p>
        Lila loved sunflowers—they reminded her of her grandmother, who always said: *“Even in shadows, the sunflowers find the light.”*  
        When Lila moved to the city feeling lonely, her neighbor surprised her with a small bouquet.  
      </p>

      <p>
        That single act sparked a chain of kindness. Soon, neighbors exchanged flowers, stories, and smiles. Lila realized that hope often arrives quietly, through small gestures that remind the heart of warmth and connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        By summer’s end, Lila’s window overflowed with sunflowers. Each bloom a testament: even in the darkest seasons, light—and love—always finds a way in.
