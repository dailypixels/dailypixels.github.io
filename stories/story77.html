      <p>
        When Liam and Jonah first met in elementary school,  
        no one would have guessed they would one day  
        call each other brothers.  
        Liam was quiet, the kind of boy  
        who always sat at the edge of the classroom.  
        Jonah was the opposite—  
        loud, reckless, and always in trouble.  
      </p>

      <p>
        But one afternoon,  
        when bullies cornered Liam on the playground,  
        Jonah was the one who stepped in.  
        From that moment forward,  
        they were inseparable.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Life, however, has a way of testing bonds.  
        In high school, Jonah spiraled—  
        skipping classes, fighting,  
        even running with the wrong crowd.  
        Liam tried to pull him back,  
        but sometimes words weren’t enough.  
        Their friendship cracked,  
        until one night Jonah didn’t come home.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks later, Liam found him  
        on the edge of town,  
        sitting beneath a broken bridge,  
        tired and ashamed.  
        Jonah whispered,  
        “I’m no good for anyone, especially you.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        Liam sat down beside him and replied,  
        “Then let’s build something better. Together.”  
        That night, they made a pact—  
        to hold each other accountable,  
        to never let silence win,  
        and to rebuild their lives  
        like planks on a bridge,  
        one piece at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years passed.  
        Jonah worked hard,  
        leaving old habits behind.  
        Liam, ever steady,  
        cheered every small victory.  
        By the time they were thirty,  
        Jonah had become a counselor  
        for troubled teens,  
        and Liam was teaching literature.  
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, they returned  
        to that same broken bridge.  
        It had been rebuilt by the town,  
        stronger than before.  
        They leaned against the railing,  
        the sunset painting the sky in gold.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “See?” Jonah smiled.  
        “We didn’t just fix the bridge.  
        We built one of our own.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        Liam laughed,  
        clapping a hand on his friend’s shoulder.  
        And in that moment,  
        both of them knew—  
        true friendship is not about perfection,  
        but about persistence.
