        When the old bridge collapsed after the storm, the town was divided. Children couldn’t reach school, markets were unreachable, and people felt isolated. Many lost hope, but Arun saw the chance to unite everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        He organized a team of volunteers, working tirelessly day and night. Nails, ropes, and planks transformed into a sturdy bridge. Every hand contributed, every small effort mattered.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the bridge was finally complete, the town crossed it together, laughter and gratitude echoing. Arun realized that hope is built like a bridge—one small action at a time, connecting people and dreams.
