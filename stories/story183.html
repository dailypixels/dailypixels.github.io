        Years apart, Nora and Liam never forgot the winter they first fell in love. Life had carried them across continents, but every snowfall reminded them of each other.
      </p>

      <p>

        She arrived at a warmly lit cabin, and there he was—Liam, waiting, holding a cup of cocoa and a scarf she had knitted long ago. Words failed them, but their smiles and tears said everything.
      </p>

      <p>
