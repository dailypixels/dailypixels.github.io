        At midnight, a train rolled into the abandoned Eastwood Station, though no passengers were scheduled and no crew was seen. Yet the doors slid open, and a handful of strangers boarded, each carrying secrets heavier than their luggage.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Among them was Zara, a journalist chasing a story about disappearances linked to this very train. She noticed there were no stops listed, no conductor present—only a haunting silence and the sound of wheels against endless tracks.  
      </p>

      <p>
        As hours passed, the passengers began confessing—guilt, regrets, betrayals—as though the train compelled them. Zara realized each person’s burden mirrored her own hidden scars. The train wasn’t taking them to a place—it was forcing them to confront themselves.  
      </p>

        When dawn came, Zara awoke at the same station where she had entered. The train was gone. But the weight in her chest had lifted; she carried clarity instead of fear. The others had vanished without a trace, leaving only faint echoes of voices in the fog.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Some say the Last Train to Nowhere comes only to those who are lost within. Whether real or imagined, its journey leaves no tracks—only changed souls.
