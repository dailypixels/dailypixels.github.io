      <p>
  It began as a rumor — a place where dreams went to rest.  
  <br><br>
  Locals called it “The Field Between Hours,” a meadow said to exist only when the world stopped hurrying.  
  <br>
  I didn’t believe it, of course. Until I found it.
</p>

<p>
  The air there was different — soft, slow, almost tender.  
  <br>
  Grasses whispered like breathing.  
  <br>
  Every petal, every stalk of wheat, moved as if remembering something half-forgotten.  
  <br>
  And when I stepped into the field, the noise inside me — the endless thoughts — finally went quiet.
</p>

<p>
  I walked deeper, my footsteps swallowed by gold.  
  <br>
  In the center stood a small wooden bench, weathered and lonely.  
  <br>
  Someone had carved a sentence into its side:  
  <em>“Sit, and the earth will finish your unfinished dreams.”</em>
</p>

<p>
  So I sat.  
  <br>
  Minutes — or hours — passed. I couldn’t tell. Time seemed to loosen its hold.  
  <br>
  Around me, the field shimmered in twilight — not dark, not light, but something eternal between.  
  <br>
  The air grew warm, and I could almost see shapes moving in the wind — faint outlines of faces, smiles, fragments of old hopes.
</p>

<p>
  Then I heard it — a hum, low and distant, like lullabies sung by the soil itself.  
  <br>
  I closed my eyes.  
  <br>
  When I opened them, the bench beside me was empty — yet I felt lighter, as if the field had quietly taken what I could no longer carry.
</p>

<p>
  When I left, the path behind me had vanished — replaced by a sea of swaying light.  
  <br>
  I didn’t look back.  
  <br>
  Some places aren’t meant to be found twice.  
  <br>
  They only appear when your heart needs to remember how to dream.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
  The Field Where Dreams Fell Asleep reminds us that rest is not the end of creation — it’s part of it.  
  Nature teaches us that even stillness is alive, waiting to carry our forgotten dreams back to bloom.
