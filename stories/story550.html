      <p>
        The winter when the river froze solid, kids from the village turned it into their playground. Skates carved silver trails into the ice, and laughter echoed through the valley. For young Mila, it was the happiest season of her life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now grown, Mila returned to the same river. The ice no longer formed thick enough to hold children, and the valley echoed only with wind. Yet she carried the sound of those winters inside her, proof that joy once lived here.
      </p>

      <p>
        She realized that memories, like frozen rivers, cannot be recreated exactly — but their reflection stays with us, shimmering in the heart long after the season has passed.
