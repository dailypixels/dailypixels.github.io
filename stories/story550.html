      <p>
        When Elena moved into the little house on the corner, the yard was nothing but weeds and broken soil. Her neighbors whispered about her husband’s passing, about how she’d lost her laughter, about how she only left the house for groceries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The truth was, Elena had forgotten how to begin again.
      </p>

      <p>
        One morning, while taking out the trash, she noticed a single flower growing stubbornly between the cracks of the broken walkway — a small yellow bloom, fragile yet certain. Something in it tugged at her heart.
      </p>
<p>
She knelt down, touched the petals, and whispered, “You shouldn’t even be here… but you are.”
</p>
<p>
The next day, she bought a packet of seeds. She didn’t expect much, but she planted them anyway. Just a handful, scattered in the dirt.
</p>
<p>
Weeks passed. Slowly, green shoots began to rise. Elena watered them every morning, pulled weeds in the evenings, and for the first time in months, her hands felt busy with purpose.
</p>
<p>
By summer, her yard had transformed. Sunflowers leaned toward the sky, wildflowers danced in the wind, and vines crept gracefully along the fence. Neighbors began stopping by, not out of pity, but to admire. Children laughed and pointed at butterflies.
</p>
<p>
Elena sat on the porch, watching life return not only to the soil, but to herself. She realized grief would never vanish — but it could bloom into something softer when given space.
</p>
<p>
The garden became her sanctuary, each flower a small triumph, each bloom a reminder: healing doesn’t arrive all at once — it grows, one seed at a time.
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  The story reminds us that even in the aftermath of loss, hope can take root in the smallest acts. Growth doesn’t erase grief, but it can transform it into beauty that sustains us.
