      <p>
        The fog rolled in thick that night, swallowing the streets in a ghostly haze.  
        Streetlights flickered like dying candles, and every sound seemed amplified:  
        the echo of my footsteps, the whisper of wind, and… something else.  
        A voice. Faint. Calling my name.
      </p>

      <p>
        I froze.  
        “Hello?” My voice sounded small, muffled by the mist. No reply—just the soft scrape of something dragging 
        across the pavement. I turned, heart pounding, but the street was empty.  
        The kind of empty that makes you feel like you’re not alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I picked up my pace, clutching my bag tighter. The fog was so thick I could barely see two feet ahead, 
        and the buildings on either side loomed like shadows. My phone buzzed in my pocket.  
        <em>Unknown number: Don’t turn around.</em>  
        I stopped breathing.
      </p>

      <p>
        My pulse hammered in my ears. This had to be a prank. I forced a shaky laugh and kept walking.  
        Another buzz: <em>Left turn. Now.</em>  
        Against my better judgment, I obeyed, ducking into an alley. The fog was even denser here, 
        clinging to my clothes like wet silk.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who’s there?” I whispered. That’s when I saw it—a figure at the far end of the alley, 
        barely visible through the haze. They didn’t move. Didn’t speak. Just stood there, watching.  
        My phone buzzed again. <em>Run.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I ran. The sound of footsteps behind me confirmed what I already knew: someone was chasing me.  
        The alley twisted and turned, the fog swallowing every exit sign. My lungs burned, 
        and just as panic threatened to take over, I saw it—a door, slightly ajar, glowing faintly from within.  
        I threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Silence. Just my ragged breathing and the hum of fluorescent lights. I was in a stairwell, 
        empty and cold. My phone buzzed one last time.  
        <em>You’re safe. For now.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I sank to the floor, shaking. Whoever was out there… knew my name. Knew where I’d be.  
        And if this was only the beginning, I wasn’t sure I wanted to know how it ended.
