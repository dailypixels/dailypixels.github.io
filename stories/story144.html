     <p><strong>Part I: The Forest That Sang</strong></p>

<p>The Forest of Elendir had been silent for a hundred years. Once, its trees had sung with voices of silver and gold, their melodies rippling through the air like sunlight on water. But when the last Silver Tree fell, its song vanished — and with it, the heart of the realm.</p>

<p>Lyra, a young bard from the borderlands, had grown up hearing whispers of that music. Her mother used to say that the trees remembered the voices of those who loved them. So when the crops failed and the rivers turned to mist, Lyra took her lute and followed the fading echoes into the forest’s heart.</p>

<p>She walked for three nights beneath a sky that never changed. The deeper she went, the more the world forgot color. Finally, she found it — the last Silver Tree, standing in a pool of moonlight, its bark glowing faintly like frost. Beneath it sat an old man with eyes the color of storm clouds.</p>

<p>“You came late,” he said, voice soft but strong. “The song is almost gone.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll sing it back,” Lyra replied.</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The Keeper of Roots</strong></p>

<p>The man introduced himself as Kael, Keeper of the Tree. He told her that the forest’s magic was bound to the Silver Tree’s song — a harmony sustained by those who remembered love, loss, and sacrifice. When the last bard died, silence claimed the woods. “Only one with a heart unbroken can awaken the song again,” he said.</p>

<p>Lyra plucked her lute, her fingers trembling. Notes floated into the air, fragile as glass. The tree shimmered faintly, then dimmed again. “It doesn’t remember me,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Kael watched her, sadness hidden behind his calm. “Because you haven’t given it what it needs most — truth.”</p>

<p>So she sang her truth. About her village, her dying mother, her lost faith in the old gods. Her voice cracked, but the melody rose like dawn over winter hills. The branches began to glow brighter — and then Kael stepped forward, placing his hand upon the trunk. The tree pulsed with light.</p>

<p>“You’ve woken it,” he said. “But now it must feed.”</p>

<p>“Feed?” Lyra asked, unease crawling through her chest.</p>

<p>“Every Silver Tree needs a soul to keep its song alive.”</p>

<p><strong>Part III: The Choice</strong></p>

<p>Lyra recoiled. “No. There must be another way.”</p>

<p>Kael smiled sadly. “There is. The one who gives their soul may choose another to take their place.”</p>

<p>She realized then — the Keeper wasn’t ageless by magic. He was ageless by sacrifice. “You’ve been its voice,” she whispered. “For a hundred years.”</p>

<p>He nodded. “And now my voice fades.”</p>

<p>The tree’s glow flickered. The forest around them began to dissolve into shadow. Without the song, everything — every creature, every memory — would vanish. Kael reached out his hand. “Take my place, Lyra. Or save yourself. But choose quickly — the silence hungers.”</p>

<p>Lyra looked at her lute, then at the man whose eyes held centuries of sorrow. The melody still lingered on her lips. Slowly, she set the lute aside and took his hand.</p>

<p>“I will sing,” she said. “For all of us.”</p>

<p>Light exploded from the Silver Tree. The sound was like every heartbeat in the world striking once, together. Kael smiled — and vanished into the light.</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: The New Song</strong></p>

<p>When dawn came, the forest was alive again. Birds sang, rivers danced, and the air shimmered with soft music. Travelers who passed through the borderlands swore they could hear a woman’s voice among the leaves — gentle, unending, filled with sorrow and beauty.</p>

<p>In the center of the forest stood the Silver Tree, brighter than ever. And beneath its roots, a single lute rested, strings still vibrating in tune with the world’s first song.</p>

<p>Lyra’s body was gone — but her melody remained.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Song of the Silver Tree</em> speaks of the power of art, memory, and sacrifice. It reminds us that beauty often demands a price — and that true love for the world is not in keeping it for ourselves, but in giving ourselves to keep it alive. 🌙🎶🌳</p>
