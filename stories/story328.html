        Noah had always written late, but tonight the library felt different. The clock struck midnight, and a soft glow spread across the bookshelves. One by one, volumes began to hum.

      <p>
        Drawn to a dusty tome, he opened it to find blank pages. Then words formed before his eyes—not his handwriting, but something older, alive. “Write with us,” the book whispered. His pen lifted on its own, scrawling lines he’d never imagined.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours passed like seconds. Characters leapt from parchment, dancing in moonlight, urging him to continue. Noah realized this was no ordinary library—it was a place where stories wrote themselves, where imagination was a doorway rather than a cage.
      </p>

      <p>
        When dawn came, the glow faded. The book snapped shut, leaving him with ink-stained hands and a manuscript unlike anything he had dreamed. The library had vanished, but the story remained.
