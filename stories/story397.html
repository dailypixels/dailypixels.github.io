  <hr>

<p>Hollow Point looked peaceful from afar. The town sat at the edge of a dense pine forest, its houses lined neatly along a single winding road. There was nothing outwardly strange about it except that every clock seemed to run slightly out of sync. Fifty-seven seconds fast. Fifty-seven seconds slow. Never quite right.</p>
<p>Elara Venn noticed it the moment she arrived. She had come to investigate a string of odd disappearances linked loosely to the town’s only clock shop: Verrin & Co. Timecrafts, owned by an elderly artisan known as Master Verrin.</p>
<p>The shop was dim inside, smelling of brass polish and dust. Hundreds of gears, cogs, and springs hung on the walls like trophies. Clocks of all shapes ticked erratically, their rhythms clashing like a chorus out of tune.</p>
<p>Master Verrin appeared from the backroom with unsettling silence. His eyes were a pale, washed-out blue, almost silver. He smiled in a way that never reached them.</p>
<p>“You’re here about the missing,” he said gently, before she had even introduced herself.</p>
<p>Elara’s pulse spiked. “How did you know?”</p>
<p>“Time always tells me who is coming.”</p>
<p>She should have left then, but something compelled her to stay.</p>
<p>The old man led her deeper into the shop, where an enormous clock stood against the back wall. Taller than two men, built entirely of interlocking brass rings, it pulsed with a faint internal glow. Elara had never seen craftsmanship like it.</p>
<p>“This is my life’s work,” Verrin said. “The Resonance Engine. A clock that listens to time instead of measuring it.”</p>
<p>Elara asked what that meant. The old man gestured for her to watch.</p>
<p>He wound a lever. The Engine shuddered, spinning its rings with fluid precision. The air vibrated. The ticking in the room ceased altogether. The silence became so profound it pressed against her ribs.</p>
<p>Then something impossible happened.</p>
<p>The shop’s lantern flames froze mid-flicker. Dust hung unmoving in midair. Outside the window, a bird paused mid-flight, suspended in the sky.</p>
<p>Time stopped.</p>
<p>Elara stumbled backward. “What have you done?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Verrin whispered. “I simply asked time to breathe.”</p>
<p>The Engine continued to hum like a heartbeat. Verrin stepped between the frozen lanterns and reached for a small brass key embedded in the machine’s center.</p>
<p>“Most people rush through life. Time hides its warnings in the noise. I wanted to hear them clearly.”</p>
<p>“What warnings?”</p>
<p>He turned his pale gaze on her. “Every person whose rhythm falls too far out of sync disappears from the flow. They become… unstuck.”</p>
<p>Elara’s breath caught. “The missing people?”</p>
<p>“Trapped,” Verrin confirmed, voice trembling. “Neither here nor in the next moment. The Engine lets me feel them, but I cannot bring them back. Not alone.”</p>
<p>He held out the brass key.</p>
<p>“You can hear them too, if you are brave. The Engine responds strongly to people who question the world around them.”</p>
<p>Against her better judgment, Elara touched the key.</p>
<p>Everything shifted.</p>
<p>A flood of whispered voices rushed into her mind. Pleas. Confusion. Names she recognized from the missing-person reports. They were close, yet impossibly distant.</p>
<p>The voices pulled at her, tugging her toward the Engine.</p>
<p>Suddenly she understood.<br>
The machine did not stop time. It thinned it, stretching each moment until the lost ones hovered in the spaces between seconds. Verrin had built a doorway he could not pass through.</p>
<p>Elara steadied herself and tightened her grip on the key.</p>
<p>“Show me where they are,” she demanded.</p>
<p>The Engine’s hum deepened. The brass rings spun in reverse, unwinding layers of time like pages in a book. A crack appeared in the air, shimmering like fractured glass.</p>
<p>Through it, she saw a corridor of frozen seconds.<br>
People stood suspended mid-step, mid-breath, mid-thought. Their eyes moved, following her. They recognized her.</p>
<p>The Engine struggled, metal groaning.</p>
<p>Verrin cried out, “Hurry. The moment will collapse.”</p>
<p>Elara plunged her hand through the fractured barrier and grabbed the nearest figure, pulling them through. The second she touched them, the corridor shimmered violently.</p>
<p>The Engine screamed.<br>
Time snapped back.</p>
<p>The lantern flames flickered again. Dust fell. Outside, the bird finished its wingbeat.</p>
<p>Elara collapsed on the floor beside the rescued figure, a young man who gasped as if waking from deep sleep. Verrin knelt beside them, tears streaking his wrinkled face.</p>
<p>“You did what I could not,” he whispered.</p>
<p>She looked up at the massive Engine, still humming faintly. “We need to shut it down. Or rebuild it. Something is broken.”</p>
<p>Verrin shook his head. “Time is broken. The Engine only reveals it.”</p>
<p>Elara stared at the old man and realized he had aged decades beyond his appearance. Tinkering with time had worn him thin, pulling years out of him like threads.</p>
<p>She rose and placed a hand on the machine’s surface. The hum felt warm, almost alive, as if listening.</p>
<p>“We will fix this,” she said firmly. “We will bring the others back.”</p>
<p>Verrin nodded weakly. “You hear the rhythm now. That makes you its new keeper.”</p>
<p>The title weighed heavily, but she accepted it. Someone had to guide the lost back from the seams of time.</p>
<p>Hollow Point would never run on normal hours again.</p>
