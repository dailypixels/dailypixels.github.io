        Layla found the envelope tucked in the back of her grandmother’s drawer, yellowed with time. Her fingers trembled as she opened it. Inside was a letter addressed to her, written decades ago, but never sent. The words carried a gentle apology, advice for life’s hardships, and wishes for happiness that she hadn’t known she needed.  
      </p>
      <p>
        As Layla read, memories of her childhood flooded back—the smell of freshly baked bread, bedtime stories, and quiet evenings by the fireplace. The letter was a bridge between past and present, a voice from someone she loved deeply but now only remembered through stories.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Tears fell, but they were soft, comforting. For the first time in years, Layla felt whole, carrying the wisdom and love that transcended time. She folded the letter carefully, knowing that her grandmother’s words would continue to guide her. Some closures arrive late, but when they do, they heal entirely.
