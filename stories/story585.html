  The road ended where the forest began.  
  <br><br>
  Beyond the wooden sign marked <em>The Whispering Grove</em>, the air changed — thicker, gentler, as if breathing slower.  
  <br>
  I carried only my camera and a small notebook, hoping the silence would do what words could not: heal what the city had taken.
</p>

<p>
  The trees stood like sentinels of time, their bark veined with emerald moss.  
  <br>
  Every gust of wind made them murmur — not just rustle, but murmur — like a language older than sound.  
  <br>
  Somewhere between those whispers, I felt my pulse fall into rhythm with the earth’s.
</p>

<p>
  At a clearing, I found a fallen oak. Its roots curled upward, revealing stones, soil, and a small wooden carving half-buried beneath. I brushed the dirt away.  
  <br>
  It was a figure of a woman holding a bird — hand-carved, weathered smooth by rain.  
  <br>
  On the base, faint letters read: <em>For Mira — who listened.</em>
</p>

<p>
  I sat there for hours, the camera forgotten. The forest didn’t demand attention; it invited it.  
  <br>
  I could hear everything — the hum beneath the leaves, the sigh of roots drinking from hidden streams.  
  <br>
  It wasn’t noise. It was presence.  
  <br>
  For the first time in years, I didn’t feel alone.
</p>

<p>
  That night, I camped beneath a canopy of stars. The grove shimmered in silver light.  
  <br>
  Just before sleep, I heard it — faint, like a breath through wind: <em>Thank you for listening.</em>  
  <br>
  I opened my eyes, heart trembling. The carving lay beside me now, freshly cleaned, as if someone — or something — had moved it there.
</p>

<p>
  When dawn came, I took only one photograph — not of trees or light, but of the carving on the moss.  
  <br>
  Back in the city, when people asked what I found, I simply said, “A place that remembers you when you forget yourself.”  
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
  The Whispering Grove teaches that nature doesn’t speak in words — it speaks in presence.  
  It waits patiently for us to listen, and when we do, it gives us back the parts of ourselves we thought were lost.
