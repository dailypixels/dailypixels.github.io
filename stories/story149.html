      <p>
        After a devastating fire destroyed her bakery, Mia felt her world collapse.  
        The smoke, ashes, and lost memories seemed insurmountable, yet a spark of determination flickered inside her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She began rebuilding—first sweeping away the debris, salvaging what she could, and planning her next steps carefully.  
        Each day, she worked harder than the last, learning new recipes, improving her craft, and reconnecting with the community that had once supported her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Slowly, the bakery reopened, not as it was before, but stronger, brighter, and more inspiring.  
        Customers returned, drawn not only by the pastries but by the story of resilience and unwavering spirit behind them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mia realized that setbacks are temporary, and the strength to rise again comes from determination, hope, and the willingness to rebuild—even from the ashes.
