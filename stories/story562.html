      <p>
        The house on Hallow Street had been empty for thirty years. Children dared each other to throw stones at its windows, and adults crossed the road rather than pass its gate. They said the house waited.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kamil never believed in such things. He was a journalist with a fading career, desperate for a story that would sell. “A haunted house,” he scoffed. “Perfect headline.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He entered one night with only a flashlight and notebook. The air inside was thick with dust, but it wasn’t silence that unnerved him—it was the faint sound of breathing, slow and deliberate, echoing through empty halls.
      </p>

      <p>
        He searched every room. Nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then he noticed the dust on the floor. In every room he entered, there were already footprints. His size. His shape. Leading ahead of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kamil’s chest tightened. He followed the trail upstairs, where the wallpaper peeled in strips like shedding skin. At the end of the hallway stood a mirror, tall and cracked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The footprints stopped in front of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He raised his flashlight. The reflection stared back—not just him, but something behind him. A figure, blurred, grinning.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spun around. Nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he turned back to the mirror, the figure was closer, its grin stretching unnaturally wide. And then—his reflection lifted its hand, independent of his own, and pressed against the glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kamil ran. He burst out into the street, gasping under the night sky. The house loomed, silent as ever. But now, from the upstairs window, his own face stared down at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The house wasn’t empty. It never had been. It waited—for him.
        </p>

          Meaning / Reflection
        </h2>
        <p>
          Horror lives not in the house, but in what we bring to it—our fear, our pride, our disbelief. The story reminds us that <b>some places don’t just hold secrets; they hold you</b>.
