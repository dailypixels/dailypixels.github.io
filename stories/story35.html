      <p>
        Rain slicked streets always made the city look cleaner than it was, like a film noir set built to hide its secrets.  
        I pulled my coat tighter and quickened my pace, the sound of footsteps echoing behind me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I turned a corner into an alley I knew well—at least, I thought I did. The neon sign for the diner flickered ahead, 
        but the air felt wrong. Too still.  
        The footsteps stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You shouldn’t be here,” a voice whispered. It came from somewhere behind me, low and calm, like someone discussing 
        the weather. I spun around, but the alley was empty.  
        My heart thudded. Every instinct screamed at me to leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        I took a step forward. Another voice followed, this time from the shadows. “Too late now.”  
        The words were soft, but they froze me in place. I realized I wasn’t alone—there were at least two people, maybe three, 
        watching me from the darkness.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What do you want?” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Silence answered. Then came a faint click,  
        like a lighter being flicked open, and for a split second, a face was illuminated in the glow—a stranger,  
        wearing a mask painted with a crooked smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Panic surged. I bolted back toward the street, feet splashing through puddles, 
        but the sound of footsteps followed, faster now, closing in.  
        I stumbled out of the alley and into the glare of streetlights. A bus roared past, blocking the view behind me.  
        When it passed, the alley was empty again.
      </p>

      <p>
        I stood there, soaked and shaking, certain I’d been marked.  
        And then I saw it: a playing card, soaked and plastered to the sidewalk.  
        A joker, grinning up at me.  
        Someone had left a message. And I had no idea what game I’d just been pulled into.
