      <p> It began with a lost postcard. <br><br> Aiden found it tucked between the pages of a second-hand book — a travel journal from a small bookstore in Lisbon. The card had no name, no address. Just a few words: <br> *“If you find this, write back. I believe in coincidences.”* </p> <p> He smiled, half amused, half intrigued, and on a whim, he wrote back. He left his note in the same book and placed it back on the shelf the next day. <br> Weeks later, when he returned, there was another postcard waiting. <br><br> *“So you answered. I wasn’t sure you would. — L”* </p> <p> And that was how it began — a letter exchange that crossed no formal addresses, no real names, just initials: **A** and **L**. <br> Aiden wrote from Lisbon. L wrote from somewhere she called *“a city of fog and bridges.”* <br> They shared stories, memories, dreams — and the kind of honesty that only happens when you believe you’ll never truly meet. </p> <p> Months passed. The bookstore became their invisible post office. Every time Aiden left a book there, he wondered if she’d find it. Every time she replied, he could almost hear her voice between the lines. <br><br> One day, her letter began differently. <br> *“A, do you ever think about what it means to miss someone you’ve never met?”* <br><br> He didn’t answer right away. Because he did — more than he wanted to admit. </p> <p> When he finally wrote back, he told her everything — how he checked the shelf daily, how her handwriting had become his favorite color, how he started dreaming of fog and bridges. <br> He ended it simply: <br> *“If I ever find you, I hope the world doesn’t change too much before I do.”* </p> <p> Then one day, the letters stopped. <br><br> No reply. No postcard. No sign of *L.* <br> Aiden waited for weeks, then months. The bookstore closed for renovations, and the shelf was gone. <br> He tried to move on — but every sky he looked at felt like a message she hadn’t finished writing. </p> <p> Two years later, Aiden found himself in San Francisco for work. He was walking across the Golden Gate Bridge when he saw it — a street stall selling old books, one of them titled *Letters from Lisbon.* <br><br> He picked it up, laughing quietly at the coincidence, until a familiar handwriting caught his eye inside the cover. <br> It read: <br> *“To A — I always hoped the sky would bring us closer.”* <br> And there she was. Standing beside the stall, holding a coffee cup, her scarf the same shade of twilight. </p> <p> She looked up. <br> Their eyes met, and she smiled — that quiet, knowing smile that said, *“You found me.”* <br><br> He didn’t speak for a long moment. Then, softly: <br> “Do you still believe in coincidences?” <br> She laughed, wiping a tear. “No,” she whispered. “I believe in us.” </p> <p> They spent the evening walking along the bridge, watching planes streak across the dusky sky — like the first postcard that started it all. <br><br> There were no promises, no grand declarations — just two people who had already lived a thousand days together in words, now finally standing side by side in silence. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Sky Between Us* reminds us that sometimes, love doesn’t begin with faces — it begins with words, hope, and timing. <br><br> It’s about how connection can travel through distance, through paper and wind, and still arrive — exactly when it’s meant to. <br> Because real love isn’t about finding someone nearby — it’s about finding someone who makes the sky between you feel smaller. ☁️💌 </p>
