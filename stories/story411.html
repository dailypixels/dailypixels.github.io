        In the heart of an old city, a tiny clock shop ticked quietly. The owner, Mr. Farid, was known for fixing anything, but he never sold his favorite clock—a golden antique with delicate engravings. Rumor had it that this clock held a secret.

      <p>
        Layla, an apprentice with dreams of invention, begged him to teach her its mechanism. Days turned into weeks. She learned patience, precision, and the subtle art of listening—not to the tick, but to the spaces in between.  
      </p>

      <p>
        One night, while adjusting the golden clock, Layla discovered a hidden compartment containing letters from a boy to his mother, written decades ago. They spoke of courage, hope, and a promise to return after war. Tears blurred her vision. She realized the clock didn’t just measure hours—it preserved stories.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Mr. Farid smiled. “Every clock has a heartbeat. Some are loud, some silent. But the best ones remind us why we keep going.” Layla understood: her work wasn’t just about fixing gears; it was about honoring the moments, memories, and dreams they represented.
