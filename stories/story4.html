     <p> The countdown reached zero. Inside the containment sphere, a burst of light exploded — tiny galaxies swirling into existence. Dr. Hale stepped back, breath caught in his chest. He had just created a pocket universe — a cosmos only one inch wide. </p> <p> For the first thirty seconds, he watched in awe. Nebulas formed, stars ignited, and planets began to orbit in perfect harmony. At forty seconds, he realized something impossible — time inside the sphere was moving faster. Much faster. </p> <p> By the fiftieth second, entire civilizations had emerged. He saw cities glittering, wars raging, oceans rising. And by the fifty-ninth second — they had already looked up and discovered *him*. </p> <p> One second remained. Inside, billions of tiny beings were kneeling, praying to the figure beyond the glass. Dr. Hale’s hands trembled. He reached for the switch to stop it — but froze. What if this was how his own world had started? </p> <p> The timer hit sixty. The light flickered once — then vanished. The universe collapsed into silence, leaving only a faint warmth in his palm. </p> <p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The One-Minute Universe* reminds us of the fragile, beautiful loop of existence. We seek to understand creation — never realizing we might be living inside someone’s experiment, counted in someone else’s sixty seconds. ⏳ </p>
