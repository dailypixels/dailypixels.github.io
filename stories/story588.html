      <p>
  The garden gates were heavier than I remembered.  
  <br><br>
  Rusted iron, twisted vines, and silence thicker than soil.  
  <br>
  I pushed them open, and the air that met me smelled of earth, rain, and ghosts of old petals.
</p>

<p>
  It had been fifteen years since I last stepped inside.  
  <br>
  The paths I once mapped were gone, devoured by ivy and wild ferns.  
  <br>
  And yet — against all reason — tulips bloomed beside frostbitten roses.  
  <br>
  Spring and winter shared the same breath here.
</p>

<p>
  At the heart of the garden stood the sundial — cracked and tilted, its shadow pointing nowhere.  
  <br>
  My mentor, the old gardener, had once said, “This garden doesn’t obey the seasons. It obeys memory.”  
  <br>
  I used to laugh. But now, looking around, I wasn’t so sure he’d been wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Kneeling beside the sundial, I brushed away a carpet of golden leaves. Beneath it, carved faintly into stone, was a message:  
  <br>
  <em>“When you stop keeping time, everything begins again.”</em>  
  <br>
  The words felt alive — as if the earth had whispered them itself.
</p>

<p>
  A soft wind moved through the garden, scattering petals from every bloom — lilac, marigold, camellia, all dancing together.  
  <br>
  For a moment, it looked as if time had dissolved entirely — all the seasons blending into one living breath.
</p>

<p>
  I stood there until dusk, watching the flowers close.  
  <br>
  Not by schedule. Not by season.  
  <br>
  By choice.
</p>

<p>
  When I finally turned to leave, I realized my notebook — once full of notes about control, balance, and predictability — felt meaningless.  
  <br>
  Nature didn’t need to be managed. It only needed to be trusted.  
  <br>
  Some places heal by forgetting what time demands of them.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
  The Garden of Unwritten Seasons reminds us that nature’s wisdom lies in imperfection.  
  When we stop forcing life to follow our calendars, it finds its own beautiful rhythm again.
