      <p>
        In a small village, a boy named Ravi had only one pair of shoes—torn, patched, and too small for his growing feet. But he loved to run. Neighbors often pitied him, but Ravi never slowed down, racing barefoot when the shoes failed him.
      </p>

      <p>
        One afternoon, a visiting coach saw him sprinting across the fields, leaving even the older boys behind. The coach asked why he pushed himself so hard. Ravi smiled and replied, “Shoes may break, but my legs are strong. I run because I can.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The coach arranged for Ravi to join a local athletics program. Years later, the boy with broken shoes stood on a podium, gold medal gleaming, tears in his eyes. His story reminded everyone that limitations are only stepping stones when your spirit refuses to stop.
