      <p><strong>Part I: The Flood</strong></p>

<p>Rain had been falling for three days straight, and by dawn, the river had swallowed everything along its banks. Houses collapsed under the weight of the current, roads vanished, and with them, so did Arif’s world.</p>

<p>He stood where his home once was, clutching a soaked backpack—the only thing he managed to save. Inside were a few clothes, a photo of his parents, and the letter he never sent to his younger sister, who lived far away. The letter began with a promise: “I’m building a better life for us.”</p>

<p>Now, all he saw was ruin.</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The Bridge</strong></p>

<p>Days passed. Rescue boats came and went. Arif wandered the outskirts of the village, helping wherever he could, but inside, he was hollow. He found himself drawn each evening to the old wooden bridge that crossed the now calm but muddy river. Half of it had been washed away, the other half still stood, stubborn and broken—like him.</p>

<p>On the fourth evening, an old man sat at the edge of the bridge, mending its rope railings. His hands were steady, his eyes bright. “You’re the young man who lost his home,” he said softly without turning.</p>

<p>Arif nodded. “There’s nothing left to fix.”</p>

<p>The old man smiled faintly. “Then start with what’s still standing.”</p>

<p>He handed Arif a coil of rope. “Help me. We rebuild what we can, one knot at a time.”</p>

<p><strong>Part III: The Rebuilding</strong></p>

<p>Each morning after that, Arif joined the man. They worked silently, replacing planks, tightening ropes, steadying posts. The bridge creaked with every step, but it held. Slowly, others from the village began to join in—children carrying nails, women bringing food, men cutting new wood. The bridge became more than a path across the river; it became a symbol of what could still be saved.</p>

<p>One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Arif looked at the near-finished bridge and said, “Why did you start fixing this when everything else was gone?”</p>

<p>The old man leaned on his cane. “Because every bridge connects more than land—it connects people. And people can only cross toward tomorrow if someone believes it’s still worth reaching.”</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Letter</strong></p>

<p>Weeks later, when the bridge reopened, Arif finally sent the letter to his sister. This time, it said something different:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I lost everything, but I found something greater. I found the strength that comes from helping others stand again. When you walk across a bridge, remember—it’s not the wood that holds you, it’s the hands that built it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next morning, he crossed the bridge one last time, sunlight breaking through the mist. On the other side, new houses were rising, and children were laughing again. Arif turned back to see the bridge gleaming golden in the dawn light—proof that even from ruin, beauty can begin.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Light Beyond the Bridge</em> reminds us that loss doesn’t end a life—it reshapes it. Hope isn’t found in what we rebuild, but in the courage to start again. Every bridge we restore—whether between people or within ourselves—becomes a path back to light. 🌉✨</p>
