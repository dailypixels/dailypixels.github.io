      <p>
        Alex was the communications officer on a remote research station, monitoring signals across the Arctic. One night, a strange transmission crackled through his radio—a voice pleading for help, repeating coordinates he had never seen before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Determined to investigate, Alex donned his gear and ventured into the freezing night. The coordinates led him to a buried research pod, half-frozen under ice, but eerily intact. The voice continued, growing clearer and more desperate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside the pod, he found a man strapped to a chair, eyes wide with fear, repeating, “They’re watching… always watching.” Alex tried to untie him, but the systems in the pod activated, locking down the room. The temperature dropped rapidly, forcing Alex to find a solution before freezing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using his wits, Alex bypassed the security system, freeing the man. As they escaped the pod, the man whispered, “You were the last signal they didn’t control.”  
        Alex looked back—what he thought was a rescue turned into a revelation: the station itself was a test, designed to observe human reactions under extreme conditions. The missing researchers were never lost—they had become part of the experiment.
