        <strong>Ayaan:</strong> “What drove you to leave everything behind and travel the world?”  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sofia:</strong> “It wasn’t an impulse. I felt life was offering me a limited view, and I wanted perspective. Mountains, oceans, cities—they each have their own voice. Listening to them taught me patience, humility, and courage.”  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ayaan:</strong> “Wasn’t it terrifying at times?”  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sofia:</strong> “Absolutely. I got lost in deserts, missed flights, slept in strange towns. But fear became a guide, not a cage. Every challenge revealed resilience I didn’t know I had. I learned to trust myself and the world simultaneously.”  
      </p>
      <p>
        Sofia shared stories of friendships formed in remote villages, meals shared with strangers, and nights under starlit skies that felt like eternity. The interview became more than Q&A—it was a masterclass in embracing uncertainty, following curiosity, and turning dreams into lived experiences.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Readers walked away not just inspired to travel, but to approach life with the same openness, courage, and trust that Sofia carried across continents.
