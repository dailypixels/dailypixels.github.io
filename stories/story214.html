    <main class="story-content">
      <p>The airport was loud, but inside gate 23A, everything felt suspended — time, motion, even breath. Maya sat by the window, watching planes rise and vanish into a pale winter sky. Her fingers traced the edge of a faded envelope in her lap, the paper soft from years of handling. It was addressed to “Eli Thompson,” in handwriting she hadn’t seen in almost a decade.</p>

<p>She had written dozens of letters after he left — some filled with anger, others with longing, all of them unsent. They lived in a shoebox under her bed until last night, when she decided to finally let go. Or so she thought.</p>

<p>Her flight to Seattle was boarding soon. A new job, a new city — a new life. But as she tucked the envelope away, a familiar voice said her name.</p>

<p>“Maya?”</p>

<p>She turned, and the world stopped. Eli stood there, hair longer, eyes the same impossible blue. He looked older, tired maybe, but real — achingly real. For a heartbeat, neither spoke. Then he smiled, the same crooked smile that had once undone her completely.</p>

<p>“What are the odds?” he said softly.</p>

<p>“Ten years too late,” she whispered before she could stop herself.</p>

<p>He laughed gently, rubbing the back of his neck. “Still good with words, I see.”</p>

<p>They ended up seated next to each other on the flight — the universe’s cruel joke or its quiet mercy, she couldn’t tell. For the first hour, they spoke about safe things: work, travel, how life had changed since college. But beneath every polite word was the echo of all the ones they never said.</p>

<p>Finally, as the seatbelt sign dimmed and the clouds stretched endless below them, he asked, “Did you ever think about me?”</p>

<p>She met his gaze. “Every time I saw the sky.”</p>

<p>He inhaled sharply, eyes glinting. “I wrote to you,” he said. “Hundreds of times. I just never sent them.”</p>

<p>Her hand froze on the armrest. “So did I.”</p>

<p>They stared at each other in disbelief — two strangers who had once been everything, separated by silence but bound by the same words unsent.</p>

<p>When the flight attendants dimmed the lights, Maya reached into her bag and pulled out the old envelope. “This was the last one,” she said. “I was going to throw it away. But I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>He hesitated, then opened it. Inside was a single page, dated March 14th, 2016 — the day he left.</p>

<p><em>“Eli, if love is timing, then we were never in sync. But if it’s truth, then I’ve never stopped loving you.”</em></p>

<p>He closed his eyes, his thumb brushing her handwriting. “I think the sky knew before we did,” he murmured.</p>

<p>As the plane descended through the clouds, their hands found each other — tentative, then sure. They didn’t promise forever; they had already learned that love doesn’t need to last forever to mean forever. It just needs a moment that changes everything.</p>

<p>When they landed, Maya looked out the window and smiled. The sun had broken through the clouds, spilling gold across the wing. It felt like the sky itself had delivered the letters they never sent.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>Letters Across the Sky</em> is a story about second chances — how love can linger in silence and return when we least expect it. It reminds us that even when time separates two people, the truth written in the heart never fades. Sometimes, all it takes is one flight, one moment, to rewrite the ending we thought was already written. ☁️💌</p>
