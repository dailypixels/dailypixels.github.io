      <p>
        The cab stopped outside the faded brick building with a rusted sign that 
        read: *Hollow Pines Hotel*. Sarah had booked it last minute—just a quick 
        stopover on her way north. It looked harmless enough, but something in 
        the silence made her skin prickle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, the lobby smelled faintly of dust and old wood. The man at the desk 
        wore a dated uniform, his smile too wide, his eyes never quite meeting hers.  
        “Room 307,” he said, sliding over a tarnished brass key instead of a card.  
        “Top floor. You’ll find it... quiet here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The elevator groaned as it carried her upward. By the time she reached 
        her floor, the air felt heavier, as if the building itself was watching her. 
        She dragged her suitcase down the long corridor. Every door she passed 
        had a number—but no sound came from inside. No TVs, no footsteps, 
        not even a cough. The hotel really was silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Room 307 was just like she expected: small, simple, and a little outdated.  
        She tossed her bag on the bed, telling herself she just needed rest. But 
        when she looked at the dresser, she froze.  
        A mirror leaned against the wall, and written across its dusty surface were 
        words traced by a finger: **“Don’t stay.”**
      </p>

      <p>
        Her breath hitched. She turned, expecting someone to be behind her—but 
        the room was empty. She rubbed the mirror clean, convincing herself it 
        must have been there for years. And yet, as night fell, she couldn’t sleep.  
        Every creak of the building set her nerves on edge.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 2:17 AM, she woke to the sound of a soft knock at the door.  
        Three taps. Then silence. She held her breath, waiting, but it came again— 
        three taps, louder this time. Heart pounding, she peered through the 
        peephole. The hallway was empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        She backed away from the door, only for the knocking to start again— 
        this time from the inside of her closet.  
        She ran, fumbling with the key, slamming the door shut behind her as she 
        bolted down the silent corridor. The elevator was too far. She took the 
        stairs two at a time, the sound of footsteps following close behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she reached the lobby, the desk was empty. The front doors, 
        chained shut. She turned in panic—and there he was, the desk clerk, 
        standing just a few feet away. His wide smile never faltered.  
        “We asked you not to stay,” he said softly.  
        And then the lights went out.
