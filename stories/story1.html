    <div class="story-content">
      <p>The path began just beyond the last bus stop, where asphalt softened into dirt and the city’s noise thinned into birdsong. I had come without headphones, without destination, with only a thermos of tea and the stubborn feeling that something needed to be heard. Spring was early but certain. Buds on the alder branches were splitting like held breaths, and the creek, finally untied from ice, moved the way a sentence moves when you find the right words.</p>
      <p>I used to walk this trail with my grandmother. She would carry a little pair of shears for the dead rosehips, and pockets full of peppermints. “Listen with your hands,” she’d say, placing my palm on the rough bark, warming it with hers. It sounded like nonsense then, the kind of thing adults said to make regular activities sacred. But the older I get, the more I understand: everything becomes sacred when you let it.</p>
      <p>At the first bend, the air smelled like wet leaves and the sharp green of new grass. Robins stitched the morning together from fencepost to fencepost, and a distant dog insisted that a very important stick required attention. My boots sank a little where runoff had chewed ruts into the path. I didn’t mind. Spring is a season of messes: melted snow heaped like laundry in the ditch, last year’s oak leaves glued to the ground, worms conducting their slow subterranean orchestra.</p>
      <p>A boy on a bicycle passed me, his jacket flaring like a cape. He called out “Morning!” and it landed between us like a coin in a jar. I saved the sound in my pocket. There are days when human voices feel like interruptions and days when they feel like proof. Today, they were proof that we were moving through the same soft weather, each of us making sense of it in our own foolish ways.</p>
      <p>I stopped at the footbridge where the creek narrowed and grew argumentative. Foam threaded itself through stones, snagged on twigs, and disappeared with theatrical sighs. I unscrewed my thermos and watched the steam mingle with the breath of the water. “Listen with your hands,” I said to the railing, to the far-off window flashing sunlight, to the sap waking inside trunks. The wood beneath my fingers was cool, then warmer as if accepting the invitation.</p>
      <p>On the way back, I noticed what I had missed earlier: a stand of coltsfoot bright as buttons, a feather left like punctuation on the steps, a piece of sky repaired by a flight of geese. It felt less like I had taken a walk and more like the morning had walked through me, rearranging the furniture and cracking a window. By the time I reached the bus stop, the city had found its volume again. I didn’t mind that, either. I had my coin of “Morning,” my pocketful of creek-breath, and the sense that spring had handed me a note and I had finally read it out loud.</p>
