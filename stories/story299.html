        Mara Jennings moved into Apartment 9B to start fresh — a small studio overlooking the quiet street of Halberton Avenue. It was nothing special: faded wallpaper, creaking floorboards, and a view of the old brick building across the way. But it was hers, and after everything she’d escaped, that was enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first note appeared on the third night. It was slipped under her door, written in neat, block letters: <em>“I see you’ve settled in nicely.”</em> She thought it was a prank. The landlord brushed it off — “Teenagers, maybe.” But when a second note appeared two nights later, she began to feel the weight of eyes behind every curtain.
      </p>

      <p>
        The handwriting was the same. <em>“You shouldn’t stay up so late.”</em> No signature, no explanation. She checked her locks twice that night. The hallway was empty, yet the old elevator seemed to hum longer than usual, as if someone was lingering between floors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across the street, a single light was always on — ninth floor, window directly opposite hers. She could see the faint outline of someone pacing, slow and deliberate. Every night, the same movement. The same shadow.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of the week, she set up a small camera facing the window, determined to prove she wasn’t imagining it. But the next morning, her camera was gone — and another note lay on her kitchen counter. <em>“No pictures. Just watch.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Panic gripped her. She ran downstairs to the building manager, Mr. Crenshaw, who frowned when she told him about 9B. “Miss Jennings,” he said slowly, “you are in 9B.” The confusion in her face turned to cold dread as he pulled the tenant list from his desk drawer. Across the street, the building had no ninth floor — it had been demolished years ago after a fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, she stayed awake, lights off, staring through the rain-streaked window. The opposite building loomed dark, silent — yet as the clock struck midnight, the faint glow returned. The silhouette moved again, matching her every motion perfectly. When she raised her hand, it did too. When she stepped closer, it leaned forward. It wasn’t watching her — it was mirroring her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her breath caught as realization dawned. The window wasn’t facing another building. It was a reflection.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning, the police found her apartment empty. The windowpane was shattered outward, shards glittering like ice on the pavement below. On the counter lay a single note, damp from the rain: <em>“Your turn to watch.”</em>
