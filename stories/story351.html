      <p>
        Every evening, Elena knew her father was home when she saw his worn leather shoes by the door.  
        They carried the scent of rain, dust, and years of hard work.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he passed away, the shoes remained—a silent reminder of footsteps that once filled their home.  
        For months, Elena couldn’t move them. They anchored her grief.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, her son placed his sneakers beside them.  
        “So Grandpa won’t be alone,” he said. Tears welled in Elena’s eyes, but they were softer this time.
      </p>

      <p>
        She realized life continues—not by forgetting, but by making room for new shoes beside the old.  
        Love doesn’t leave; it shifts, creating space for the next generation to walk forward.
