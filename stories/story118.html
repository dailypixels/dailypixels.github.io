    <main class="story-content">
     <p>It began with a sandwich — an innocent, beautiful, triple-layered turkey sandwich that <em>Harold Jenkins</em> had spent forty-five minutes making before work.</p>

<p>He had toasted the bread to perfection, layered it with lettuce, tomato, and a dangerous amount of mayo, then wrapped it in foil with the precision of a NASA engineer. He placed it in the office fridge, labeled it “Harold’s Lunch — DO NOT TOUCH,” and felt the smug satisfaction of a man in control of his destiny.</p>

<p>By noon, destiny betrayed him.</p>

<p>The fridge door opened. The foil-wrapped treasure was gone. In its place lay a single, mocking slice of pickle.</p>

<p>Harold froze. “No,” he whispered. “Not again.”</p>

<p>This wasn’t the first time food had vanished in the accounting department of <strong>Greenridge Solutions</strong>. The culprit — dubbed “The Phantom of the Fridge” — had struck three times before, leaving only crumbs and chaos in their wake. But this time, Harold vowed, justice would be served (preferably with mustard).</p>

<p>He grabbed a notepad and began interrogating suspects.</p>

<p>First was <em>Linda from HR</em>. “I’m vegan, Harold,” she said flatly. “I haven’t eaten meat since you tried to microwave tuna last month.”</p>

<p>Next was <em>Greg from IT</em>, who looked guilty by default. “I swear I didn’t take it,” he stammered, crumbs dotting his keyboard. “These are from… uh, crackers.”</p>

<p>Then there was <em>Martha, the intern</em> — always too cheerful. Harold narrowed his eyes. “You were near the fridge at 11:43 a.m.,” he said dramatically. “Security footage doesn’t lie.”</p>

<p>“That was me putting almond milk in my coffee,” she replied. “Also, Harold, you’re holding the security footage upside down.”</p>

<p>Unshaken, Harold set a trap. The next day, he brought another sandwich — even bigger than before. He placed it in the fridge, this time with a hidden GPS tracker taped beneath the foil. Then he waited.</p>

<p>At 12:05, the tracker beeped. The sandwich was on the move. Harold followed the signal down the hall, around the corner, and into the janitor’s closet.</p>

<p>Inside stood <em>Mr. Ruiz</em>, the building’s elderly janitor — kindly, silver-haired, and currently chewing something that looked suspiciously like turkey. Harold’s jaw dropped. “You!” he gasped. “You’re the Phantom!”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruiz blinked, confused. “The what?”</p>

<p>Harold launched into a passionate speech about theft, betrayal, and the sanctity of sandwiches. But before he could finish, the janitor held up a small lunch bag labeled “Ruiz.” Inside, perfectly intact, was a sandwich identical to Harold’s.</p>

<p>Harold frowned. “Then where’s mine?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruiz pointed behind him. On a nearby shelf sat Harold’s sandwich — half-eaten, yes, but being enthusiastically devoured by <em>Toby</em>, the office therapy dog. The culprit wagged his tail, completely unrepentant.</p>

<p>“He gets anxious when he smells food,” Mr. Ruiz explained with a shrug.</p>

<p>Harold stared. His grand mystery, his week-long investigation, his elaborate sandwich trap — all undone by a golden retriever with abandonment issues.</p>

<p>Finally, he sighed. “I guess he needed it more than I did.”</p>

<p>From that day forward, Harold made two sandwiches — one for himself and one for Toby. The office fridge remained peaceful, and Harold earned a new title on the staff board: <strong>“Chief of Sandwich Security.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Great Sandwich Heist</em> reminds us that sometimes, the mysteries we chase aren’t meant to expose villains — but to reveal our own ability to laugh, forgive, and share. Life’s too short to lose your sandwich and your humor in the same day. 🥪😄🐾</p>
