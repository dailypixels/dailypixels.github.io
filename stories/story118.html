        Detective Riley had seen strange cases before, but this one was different.  
        People in the city were vanishing without a trace—no CCTV, no witnesses, nothing.  
        Each disappearance followed a precise pattern, yet the method remained a mystery.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following subtle clues, Riley discovered a network of abandoned tunnels beneath the city.  
        The deeper she ventured, the more elaborate the setup appeared: hidden doors, false walls, and carefully constructed traps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours passed as Riley pieced together evidence, realizing the perpetrator had intimate knowledge of the city’s underground labyrinth.  
        A sudden noise echoed behind her—someone else was in the tunnels.  
        Heart racing, she pursued the sound, each step a test of courage and instinct.
      </p>

      <p>
        At last, Riley confronted the person behind the vanishings: a former engineer, obsessed with control and precision, who believed the city’s inhabitants were “misplaced pieces” in need of perfect order.  
        A tense standoff ensued, but Riley outsmarted him, securing the victims’ release.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet the twist revealed itself as she exited: one tunnel was sealed, containing evidence of disappearances she had not yet accounted for.  
        She realized the threat wasn’t over—the engineer had left a Vanishing Point, a final test that could strike again.  
        The city seemed peaceful, but Riley knew vigilance must never falter when shadows linger just below the surface.
