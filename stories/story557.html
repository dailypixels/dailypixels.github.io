      <p>
        Nadia had never set foot inside her grandmother’s house until the night she unlocked its rusting gate. The place had been empty for years—left to sag, creak, and gather dust after her grandmother’s death. But when the keys were mailed to her along with the deed, Nadia felt an odd pull. She told herself she just wanted to see it once before selling.
      </p>

      <p>
        The house stood at the edge of the village, shadowed by trees older than memory. The moment she opened the front door, a cold draft coiled around her ankles. Dust swirled in the thin slice of moonlight that broke through a cracked window. She clicked on her phone’s flashlight and whispered to herself, “Just a house. Nothing more.”
      </p>

      <p>
        But as her boots scraped the floorboards, the sound echoed too long—too deep. It was as if the house swallowed her footsteps and gave them back to her, distorted. She froze. The air vibrated faintly, like a held breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upstairs, a door creaked open. She hadn’t touched it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nadia climbed the staircase, the wood groaning louder than it should have. At the top, the air grew heavy, thick with the scent of burnt oil and something sweet—like overripe fruit. She found the door ajar, its hinges screaming when she pushed it further.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside was her grandmother’s bedroom, exactly as if the old woman had just stepped out: blankets folded, lamp crooked, mirror tilted. Nadia’s throat went dry. In the reflection of the mirror, the room behind her seemed darker, stretched, almost… wrong
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came the sound again—her own footsteps, replayed. But they were delayed, like an echo crawling after her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her phone light flickered. She whispered her grandmother’s name. The silence after was unbearable. And then, very faintly, the house whispered it back.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whisper didn’t come from the walls or the floor. It came from inside her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nadia dropped the keys and ran. She didn’t stop until she reached the gate, breath ragged, body trembling. Behind her, the house exhaled—a long sigh through the cracked windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the villagers later found her, pale and shaken, she could only repeat the same sentence:
      </p>
      <p>
        “The house doesn’t forget. It only waits.”
