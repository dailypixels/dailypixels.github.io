      <p>
       The house was quiet, but Naomi still felt her father’s presence in the creak of the floorboards, in the smell of cedar from his workshop, in the half-finished books on the shelf. He had been gone for three weeks, yet she hadn’t been able to sort through his belongings.
      </p>

      <p>
       When the rain came that afternoon, she finally sat at his desk. Most of the drawers were filled with old receipts, pens that no longer wrote, and faded photographs. But in the very back of the lowest drawer lay an envelope with her name written in his careful handwriting:<b>Naomi</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her hands trembled as she opened it.
      </p>

      <p>
       "I was never good at saying things aloud," the letter began. "But silence is heavier than regret. If you are reading this, it means I didn’t get the chance to tell you: I am proud of you. Not because of what you achieved, but because of the person you are. I failed often as a father, but I never stopped hoping you would live with more courage than I did."
      </p>

      <p>
        Tears blurred the ink, but Naomi read to the end.
      </p>

<p>"Please forgive the distance I built between us. You carried more weight than you should have. If there is one promise I ask you to keep, let it be this: do not carry mine. Live light. Live free."</p>

<p>The rain softened outside. Naomi folded the letter and pressed it to her chest. For the first time since the funeral, she let herself cry — not only for what she had lost, but for what she had finally found: his voice, reaching her when it mattered most.</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>The story shows how words left behind can heal wounds that seemed permanent. Even in absence, love can find a way to close distances and offer peace.</p>
