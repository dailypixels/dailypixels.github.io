     <p><strong>Transcript Log – “Interview with the Clockmaker”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> A small workshop at the end of Vacheron Street, its walls covered in clocks of every size. The air smells of brass, oil, and rain. <br>
<strong>Date:</strong> October 21, 2025 <br>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Mira Devran, *The Crescent Journal* <br>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Elior Vance, master clockmaker, age 87.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Mira:</strong> Mr. Vance, your workshop is… extraordinary. Every clock seems alive. Do they all still work?</p>

<p><strong>Elior:</strong> (smiles faintly) They work as much as people do. Some keep perfect time, some lose a few seconds, and some — well, they just need someone to listen.</p>

<p><strong>Mira:</strong> Listen?</p>

<p><strong>Elior:</strong> Every clock has a story. People bring them here thinking they’re broken, but what they really bring are their regrets, their waiting, their memories. I just help them hear what they’ve been ignoring.</p>

<p><strong>Mira:</strong> You’ve been called “the man who fixes more than gears.” Do you think that’s true?</p>

<p><strong>Elior:</strong> (chuckles) I don’t fix people, dear. I remind them that time itself is merciful. Everyone thinks it runs away — but it waits. It always waits for those who choose to start again.</p>

<p><strong>Mira:</strong> That’s beautifully said. Can you tell me the most memorable clock you ever repaired?</p>

<p><strong>Elior:</strong> Ah, yes. A small golden pocket watch. A woman brought it in forty years ago. She said it belonged to her son who had gone to war and never returned. It had stopped at 11:47, the moment his last letter was dated. I fixed it, but when she picked it up, it stopped again — same time, same second. I told her, “Maybe it’s not meant to tick again.” She smiled and said, “Then let it rest where he did.”</p>

<p><strong>Mira:</strong> (softly) That’s… heartbreaking. Did that change how you saw your work?</p>

<p><strong>Elior:</strong> It made me realize time isn’t about seconds. It’s about presence. Some moments shouldn’t move forward — they should just stay. Like a photograph in the heart.</p>

<p><strong>Mira:</strong> Do you ever fear running out of time yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Elior:</strong> (looks around the ticking room) I used to. But then I learned something: clocks don’t fear stopping, because they know they’ll be wound again someday. Maybe that’s what life is — a winding we don’t fully understand.</p>

<p><strong>Mira:</strong> That’s... incredibly profound, Mr. Vance. Last question — if you could leave one message for the next generation, what would it be?</p>

<p><strong>Elior:</strong> (pauses) Be late for all the wrong things. Hurry to love, not to earn. Delay anger, not forgiveness. And remember — when time runs out, only kindness still echoes.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript:</strong><br>
A week after the interview, Mira received a small package. Inside was a tiny clock key and a note written in fading ink: *“Every minute can still be mended — if you choose to turn it.”*<br>
The letter was signed, <em>“Elior Vance, The Clockmaker.”</em> <br>
He had passed away the night after their conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>Interview with the Clockmaker</em> is a reflection on time, memory, and grace. It reminds us that while clocks measure seconds, hearts measure meaning. Time itself is not an enemy but a companion — patient, forgiving, and always waiting for us to live deliberately. ⏳❤️</p>
