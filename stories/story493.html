        After the flood, the neighborhood was a tangle of mud and lists: roofs needing repair, soaked photographs, a collapsed wall. Volunteers came with tools, soup, quiet competence. Among them was Yasir, who brought bags of seed—tomatoes, beans, a scattering of marigolds.
      </p>

      <p>
        People were weary of being told they’d *recover* someday. Yasir didn’t promise grand things. He asked only for ten square feet of space per house. “Plant something small,” he said. “Watch it grow. You’ll be surprised what that regular work does to the rest of the day.”
      </p>

      <p>
        They planted. The first week was messy and discouraging: pests took tender leaves, a cold snap browned the topsoil. But every evening hands returned to pull weeds, to water, to check on seedlings like anxious siblings. With each sprout, neighbors began swapping cuttings and stories — what their own grandmothers used to do, which vegetables grew fast, how to coax cucumbers up a trellis.
      </p>

        Months later, the neighborhood hosted a small market. People who had lost roofs sold jars of preserved tomatoes and bunches of marigolds. Children who had once counted losses began to count seedlings and smiles. The work of tending something living had taught them patience and restored rhythm when everything else had been broken.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yasir stood by the market with a bag of seeds that he now gave to anyone who needed a nudge. He had known, in his quiet way, that recovery often begins with the smallest commitments — a seed in soil, water on leaves, the daily act of showing up. The aftermath could not be dictated; it had to be grown.
