     <p> The silence began on the forty-seventh day. <br><br> Captain Arin Hale floated inside *Solara Station*, orbiting what used to be Earth — now just a swirl of storms and light. He had been waiting for a transmission from Mission Control. It never came. </p> <p> He checked the comms again — static. The hum of the engines sounded louder than usual, a reminder that he was the last living human in orbit. Or maybe anywhere. <br><br> Then, one night, a pulse broke through the static — faint, rhythmic, almost like a heartbeat. He froze. Adjusted the frequency. And there it was again: a voice. </p> <p> “Arin… can you hear me?” <br><br> It was female — soft, calm, distant. The signal was fragmented, but it carried something unmistakable: warmth. <br> He didn’t recognize it, yet it felt familiar — like a song he’d forgotten but once loved. </p> <p> “Who are you?” he whispered. <br> No response. Only the faint echo of his own breath. <br><br> He traced the signal’s origin — somewhere beyond lunar orbit. But there were no satellites left there. Nothing should have existed beyond that range. </p> <p> Over the next few days, he chased the voice. Each night it grew clearer, each word sharper: <br> *"You promised to come home."* <br><br> Arin stared at the fading planet below, memories breaking through the fog. His wife — *Lira.* The launch day. Her hand pressed against his helmet’s glass. Her voice — the same tone, the same cadence. </p> <p> He scrolled through old mission logs. The last message he’d sent from orbit was incomplete, cut off mid-sentence. *"I’ll return before—"* That was it. The rest lost in transmission. <br><br> Now, decades — or centuries — might have passed. And yet, her voice still found him. </p> <p> He set a new trajectory toward the signal source, knowing it could burn the last of his fuel. But the human heart has always been irrational in the face of hope. <br><br> As the ship glided through a sea of broken satellites and cosmic dust, he began hearing music in the background of the transmission — a lullaby Lira used to hum when the world still had stars. </p> <p> Then he saw it — not a station, not debris, but a vast shimmering sphere of light. The pulse of the signal matched its rhythm. He drifted closer. The ship’s controls flickered — time itself seemed to slow. <br><br> Inside the light, he saw a reflection — himself, younger, laughing beside Lira under the blue skies of Earth. The sphere wasn’t transmitting a message. It was echoing a memory. </p> <p> A voice spoke again: *"Arin, if you hear this, it means you made it too far. Don’t follow me into the dark. Turn back. Live.”* <br><br> But there was nowhere left to return to. He reached for the console, whispered: *"I’m already home."* <br><br> The light swallowed the ship whole. And the signal went silent. </p> <p> Weeks later, deep-space scanners — automated remnants of human technology — picked up a new beacon. A repeating signal. One line of code, looping endlessly through the void: <br> <em>“Hope is not a frequency. It’s a choice.”</em> </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Last Signal* is a story about connection beyond time — about how love and hope can travel farther than light itself. It reminds us that even when the world ends, the echoes of who we were — our memories, our promises — keep searching for a way to be heard. <br><br> Because sometimes, the last signal isn’t a call for help — it’s a reminder that we once existed, beautifully, together. 🌌📡 </p>
