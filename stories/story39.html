        The station was nearly empty, its fluorescent lights humming softly over rows of worn wooden benches.  
        Outside, the night air carried the smell of rain, and the distant rumble of a train echoed like a heartbeat.  
        I clutched my coffee cup tighter, waiting for the last train home.

        That’s when I saw her—sitting alone, a red scarf draped around her shoulders like a splash of color  
        in an otherwise gray world. She was reading, her hair falling over her face,  
        and for some reason, I couldn’t look away.
      </p>

      <p>
        The announcement crackled overhead: *“Last train departing in five minutes.”*  
        She closed her book and looked up, her eyes meeting mine.  
        For a moment, it felt like time slowed.  
        I gave a small, nervous smile. She smiled back.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ended up sitting next to each other on the train, exchanging shy glances before I finally said hello.  
        She told me her name—Lena—and that she always took the last train because it was the only time  
        the city felt quiet. We talked about everything: books, music, dreams, and little pieces of our lives  
        that felt safe to share in the cocoon of a dimly lit carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        When my stop arrived, I hesitated. She noticed. “Same time tomorrow?” she asked,  
        her smile soft but hopeful. I nodded, heart pounding as I stepped off the train.  
        I watched through the window as she waved, the train carrying her into the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        The city lights blurred behind her, but that moment stayed clear in my mind:  
        two strangers on a quiet train, finding something worth coming back for.  
        And for the first time in a long time, I couldn’t wait for tomorrow night.
