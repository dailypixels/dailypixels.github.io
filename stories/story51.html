        The river was silent, except for the steady drip of water  
        leaking from the old bridge’s beams.  
        I should have been the only one there,  
        but a low voice echoed beneath the arches—  
        as if someone was speaking directly into the fog.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I leaned over the railing, squinting into the shadows.  
        The whispers grew louder,  
        fragments of sentences I couldn’t piece together.  
        Then I saw it—  
        a faint lantern glow moving slowly across the water,  
        though no boat was there.  
      </p>

      <p>
        My phone buzzed in my pocket.  
        A single message flashed across the screen:  
        <em>“Don’t answer them.”</em>  
      </p>

      <p>
        The whispers stopped.  
        And in their place, a laugh—  
        soft at first, then rolling through the arches,  
        surrounding me.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I turned to leave,  
        but a figure was already standing at the other end of the bridge,  
        blocking the way back to town.
