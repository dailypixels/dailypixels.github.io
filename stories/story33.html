        The box was smaller than I remembered. Its edges were frayed, and the brass clasp had dulled with time.  
        I hesitated before opening it, knowing that inside were years’ worth of words I had never dared to speak aloud.
      </p>

      <p>
        One by one, I unfolded the letters. Some were angry—scribbled confessions written late at night when emotions 
        overflowed. Others were tender, full of promises I never found the courage to make. Most were simple updates:  
        “I saw a movie today. You would’ve loved it.” “I miss you.”  
        They were fragments of a life we almost lived.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last letter was dated five years ago, sealed but never sent.  
        My handwriting wavered, a reflection of the day I finally accepted you weren’t coming back.  
        I held it to my chest, feeling the weight of all those words that had stayed locked away. 
        There was no bitterness now, just a soft ache—a quiet gratitude for what we had, and even more for what I learned 
        from losing you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I lit a candle, sat by the window, and read each letter out loud to the empty room.  
        My voice trembled, but I kept reading, letting those silent years finally breathe.  
        When I was done, I tied them back together with the same ribbon I’d used years ago and placed them back in the box.
      </p>

        Some stories are never told to the people they’re written for.  
        But that doesn’t make them any less real.  
        Tonight, I finally let them go—not to forget, but to honor.  
        And for the first time in years, I felt light enough to sleep.
