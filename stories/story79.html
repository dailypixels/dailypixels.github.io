        Ava had left Willow Creek ten years ago, carrying only memories of  
        the boy who had once promised her forever.  
        Life had taken her to distant cities, endless projects, and  
        faces that couldn’t replace the one she never forgot: Liam.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liam stayed behind, rooted in the town that whispered of their youth.  
        Every autumn, he walked the pier where they had first kissed,  
        hoping the wind might carry her back.  
        Their love had been sudden, intense, and fragile—  
        torn apart by misunderstandings neither could voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        One crisp evening, Ava returned, drawn by nostalgia and a yearning  
        she couldn’t explain.  
        The pier was empty, the water still, the sky painted in gold and lavender.  
        Then she saw him—older, taller, but with the same unwavering gaze.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their eyes met. Time collapsed. Words were unnecessary.  
        Liam stepped forward, and they embraced,  
        holding on as if the years apart were mere seconds.  
        Tears mingled with laughter, and silence spoke volumes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I never stopped waiting for you,” Liam whispered.  
        Ava smiled, “And I never stopped coming back.”  
        In that moment, they understood that true love  
        isn’t lost, only patient.  
        Hearts that belong together will always find their way.
