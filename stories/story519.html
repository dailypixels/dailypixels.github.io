      <p>
        When acclaimed novelist Tariq Rahman passed away, he left behind thirty novels, countless essays, and a loyal readership. But what stirred the literary world most was a rumor—whispers of an unpublished manuscript, hidden somewhere in his study.
      </p>

      <p>
        His daughter, Ayesha, inherited the house and reluctantly faced the task of sorting through his belongings. Dust-covered typewriters, faded letters, half-written drafts filled the study. On the final shelf, behind a row of dictionaries, she found a sealed envelope addressed simply: <em>“To the one who still believes.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside was the manuscript. Not a novel, but a long letter—half memoir, half confession. Tariq wrote of his struggles with fame, his fear of being forgotten, and his belief that stories live only when shared. He admitted that the characters in his most beloved works were fragments of real people he loved and lost. The letter ended with a plea: *“Do not publish me. Read me, and then let me rest.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        Ayesha sat by the window all night, reading by the same lamp her father had used. At dawn, she closed the letter, pressed it to her heart, and burned it quietly in the garden. She felt grief, but also peace—because for the first time, she knew her father not as a famous novelist, but as a man who carried both brilliance and vulnerability.
      </p>

      <p>
        The literary world speculated endlessly about the lost manuscript. Ayesha never spoke of it. She carried the truth alone: sometimes the greatest story is the one that never reaches the public, but instead heals the heart of a single reader.
