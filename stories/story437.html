        Rafi placed the paper boat on the puddle, watching it sway gently with the rain. Memories of childhood floods, laughter, and muddy feet surged back. The boat bobbed and twisted as if carrying a tiny piece of his past.  
      </p>

        In that brief, simple moment, he remembered his grandmother’s stories, the warmth of summer evenings, and the innocence of days when the world felt vast and magical. The rain continued to fall, but for Rafi, it was not a storm—it was a time machine.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching the paper boat drift out of sight, he smiled. Nostalgia wasn’t sadness; it was a gentle reminder of the layers of life, each one delicate yet enduring, shaping who we are without our noticing.
