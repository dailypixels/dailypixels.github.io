      <p>
        The rain had begun as a whisper, tapping lightly on rooftops, gathering courage as it rolled through the empty streets. Ayaan stood under a flickering streetlight, his umbrella half-open, waiting for a bus that wasn’t coming. The scent of wet earth filled the air, thick with memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across the road, someone hurried past—umbrella tilted, coat drawn tight. For a heartbeat, he thought he recognized the way she moved.
Then she turned.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was Zara.
      </p>

      <p>
        The years between them collapsed like paper. The sound of rain softened, and for a moment the world seemed to hold its breath.
      </p>

      <p>
        She smiled faintly. “You still wait in the rain?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Ayaan laughed, unsure if it came from relief or disbelief. “Some things don’t change.”
      </p>

      <p>
        They found shelter beneath the same awning, standing close enough for their shoulders to brush. The rain sang its steady rhythm, a curtain between the past and the present.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I read your book,” Zara said quietly. “Every story felt like… us.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He hesitated. “Maybe it was.”
      </p>

      <p>
        They talked—not about what went wrong, but about everything that had survived it. Their words were small bridges built between pauses, fragile yet certain. When her hand brushed his, it didn’t feel like a beginning or an end. Just continuation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rain slowed, fading to a gentle drizzle. Ayaan looked at her, the city lights shimmering in her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you ever think,” he asked, “that some goodbyes just take longer to end?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Zara smiled, slipping her hand into his. “Maybe they’re not meant to.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As they stepped into the street, the puddles reflected two umbrellas crossing paths—then walking on together, through the last whispers of the rain.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Meaning / Reflection:
      </h2>

      <p>
        Love doesn’t always demand grand returns. Sometimes it simply waits—quietly, patiently—until two hearts remember they were never really apart.
