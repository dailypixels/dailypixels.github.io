    <main class="story-content">
     <p>The ocean had a voice — a low, endless murmur that filled the air even when the world seemed still. Ethan Rourke heard it again as he climbed the worn stone steps toward his father’s lighthouse, the same path he had run up a thousand times as a boy.</p>

<p>Now the air was colder. The light above was dark, its great lens cracked and silent. The old man who once tended it — the keeper who never missed a dawn — was gone.</p>

<p>Ethan set down his duffel and stared at the tower door. The brass nameplate read: <em>Captain Samuel Rourke, Keeper of the Light.</em> He brushed a thumb over it, whispering, “I’m back, Dad.”</p>

<hr>

<p>The lighthouse smelled of salt and dust. Cobwebs hung in the corners where his father’s tools once gleamed. He found the logbook on the desk, open to the last entry: <em>‘Storm warning at dusk. Oil levels low. Ethan still hasn’t written.’</em></p>

<p>He closed it quickly, chest tightening. They’d argued before his father’s passing — over the sea, over duty, over how a man should live. Ethan had chosen the city, chasing money and noise, while his father stayed, lighting the way for others. “You can’t live your whole life saving strangers,” Ethan had said once.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” his father had replied. “But I can make sure they get home.”</p>

<hr>

<p>That night, the wind howled as if the ocean itself was restless. The village below had long since gone dark. Ethan poured a glass of whiskey and sat by the window, watching the storm build.</p>

<p>Then he saw it — a faint flicker on the horizon. A ship’s signal light, far out at sea.</p>

<p>He frowned. The lighthouse beacon was off. If the ship was heading toward the rocks, it wouldn’t make it through the night.</p>

<p>“No,” he whispered, standing. “Not tonight.”</p>

<p>He grabbed the lantern and ran up the spiraling stairs two at a time. Each step groaned under his weight. Rain lashed the windows. When he reached the top, the lantern flame sputtered — but he shielded it with his hand, remembering his father’s steady voice: <em>“The light must never go out, no matter the storm.”</em></p>

<p>He found the old ignition lever, rusted but intact. He poured the last of the oil, struck a match, and pulled. The great glass lens flared, then caught, sending a beam of light slicing through the rain and fog — bright, defiant, alive.</p>

<p>The beacon burned again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Hours later, exhausted, Ethan stood on the balcony as dawn spread over the sea. Below, the storm had passed. Out on the horizon, a ship horn sounded twice — a sailor’s thank-you.</p>

<p>He smiled for the first time in months. “You were right, old man,” he said quietly. “It’s not just a light.”</p>

<p>As the morning sun rose, the lighthouse stood shining — and for the first time, Ethan felt not like he’d returned home, but that he had finally understood it.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Lightkeeper’s Son</em> reminds us that legacy isn’t about inheritance — it’s about illumination. The things our loved ones leave behind are not burdens, but beacons. When we pick up what they left for us, we don’t just honor their memory — we carry their light forward, guiding others and, perhaps, ourselves back home. 🌅</p>
