      <p>
        Commander Elias Vega had dreamed of this moment since childhood—setting foot on Titan, Saturn’s enigmatic moon. The silence of its frozen plains was overwhelming, broken only by the faint hum of his suit. Above him, Saturn loomed like a watchful guardian, its rings gleaming with distant sunlight.
      </p>

      <p>
        His mission was simple: collect samples, measure methane lakes, and confirm whether Titan’s chemical whispers hinted at life. But on the third day, while walking along the shoreline of Kraken Mare, he heard something impossible—an echo. Not the bounce of his own voice, but a layered resonance, like many voices speaking through the ice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following the sound, he discovered strange fissures glowing faintly beneath the frozen surface. Each vibration felt intentional, almost like language. He recorded the pulses and transmitted them back to Earth, but the delay meant he wouldn’t hear an interpretation for weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, in the safety of his habitat, he replayed the sounds again and again. He realized the patterns matched human speech rhythms—not words, but the cadence of conversation. Titan wasn’t silent. It was speaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elias pressed his gloved hand to the frozen ground and whispered, “We hear you.” The ice pulsed back, almost like an answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether alien intelligence or some natural wonder, one thing was certain: humanity was no longer alone in the universe.
