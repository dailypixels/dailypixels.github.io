        The rain had just stopped when I ducked into a small café near the Seine.  
        Tourists hurried past, umbrellas dripping, but inside, it was warm and golden.  
        I only planned to rest for an hour before catching the train south.  
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s when she walked in—coat half-buttoned, hair damp from the rain.  
        She smiled when our eyes met, and for reasons I still can’t explain,  
        I gestured to the empty chair at my table.  
      </p>

      <p>
        We spoke as if we’d known each other for years.  
        About books, cities we’d loved,  
        and the strange ache of leaving places behind.  
        Time seemed to collapse until my watch reminded me:  
        I had only ten minutes left.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “One hour isn’t enough,” I said.  
        She laughed softly, stirring her coffee.  
        “Sometimes an hour is all you need,” she whispered.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The station clock was already striking as I rushed to the platform.  
        I turned once, hoping she had followed—  
        but only the Paris rain had returned.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, I still wonder if that hour was meant to last a lifetime.  
        Love doesn’t always ask for forever.  
        Sometimes it asks only for a moment—  
        enough to remind you that it’s real.  
      </p>
