      <p>
        Nora had always loved the rain. It blurred the edges of the city, softened the noise, and gave her permission to feel fragile. That night, walking home with no umbrella, she didn’t mind being drenched.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then she saw him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Julian, standing under the awning of the old record shop, holding a single black umbrella. Time hadn’t erased the familiarity — the curve of his jaw, the way his eyes searched the crowd like he was always waiting for something. Or someone.
      </p>
<p>
Their eyes met, and suddenly the years fell away.
</p>
<p>
He stepped forward without hesitation. “Still walking in the rain without an umbrella, Nora?”
</p>
<p>
Her laugh caught in her throat. “Still carrying one for two, I see.”
</p>
<p>
They walked together through the rain-slick streets, the umbrella tilted clumsily between them. They spoke of small things — the café that had closed, the park where the swings had rusted, the songs they used to play on repeat. But beneath the words, the silence pressed: Why now? Why here?
</p>
<p>
Finally, Julian stopped at the bridge where they once carved their initials. He closed the umbrella, letting the rain soak them both.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I had more time,” he said softly. “But life doesn’t wait. I’m leaving tomorrow. A job overseas. Maybe for good.”
</p>
<p>
Nora’s chest tightened. The city lights shimmered in the water below, blurred by tears she refused to shed.
</p>
<p>
“Then why find me now?” she whispered.
</p>
<p>
He touched her cheek, rain dripping from his fingertips. “Because love shouldn’t vanish without a song. You were mine. You’ll always be mine, even if we belong to different tomorrows.”
</p>
<p>
They kissed once, tender and trembling, their lips tasting of rain and memory.
</p>
<p>
When he pulled away, he pressed the umbrella into her hands. “Stay dry, for once.” And then he walked into the night, vanishing into the rain that had first brought them together.
</p>
<p>
Nora stood on the bridge, umbrella closed at her side, letting the storm carry her grief. The rain was no longer just rain — it was a song, one she would hear forever.
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  This story reminds us that love doesn’t always end with forever. Sometimes it ends with a memory, a lesson, and the strength to carry the beauty of what was into the life that still waits ahead.
