        <strong>Liam:</strong> Maya, your work has touched so many people. Where does your inspiration come from?  
        <strong>Maya:</strong> Honestly, from life itself. The small, quiet moments often spark the biggest ideas—like watching children play or noticing the way sunlight falls through the windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Liam:</strong> You’ve faced challenges in your career. How do you overcome them?  
        <strong>Maya:</strong> I try to treat challenges like a canvas. Some days, the paint smudges. Some days, it creates something beautiful I didn’t expect. Resilience comes from accepting the process, not just the result.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Liam:</strong> Any advice for young creatives?  
        <strong>Maya:</strong> Listen to your inner voice. It might whisper in quiet moments, but it knows your path better than anyone else. And never fear failing—it’s part of the journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        The interview ended, but the warmth lingered. Maya’s perspective was a reminder that life’s beauty often hides in simplicity and courage—the kind that comes quietly, one thoughtful choice at a time.
