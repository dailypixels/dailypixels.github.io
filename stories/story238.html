        The night sky was clear and infinite, dotted with stars that seemed to twinkle in anticipation. A group of friends had gathered by the riverbank, each holding a paper lantern. The tradition was simple: write wishes, hopes, or messages of encouragement on the lanterns, and release them into the sky together.
      </p>

        Amelia, usually shy, had written a note of gratitude for her friends, thanking them for their unwavering support. As she lit the small candle inside her lantern, her friends cheered gently, encouraging her to release it. Watching it float upward, she felt a weight lift from her chest—a sense of hope and belonging she hadn’t realized she needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        One by one, each friend released their lantern, sharing pieces of their hearts, dreams, and intentions. Laughter mingled with quiet reflection, and the riverbank glowed with the warm flicker of hundreds of tiny lights. Every lantern symbolized not just hope for the future, but trust, support, and the enduring strength of friendship.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the lanterns drifted higher, some carrying personal dreams and others messages for loved ones far away, the group shared stories from the past year—moments of struggle, triumph, and mutual encouragement. They realized that their friendship was not only about shared fun, but about being a pillar for one another in times of need.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of the night, the lanterns had disappeared into the horizon, leaving the friends in a peaceful silence. They sat on the riverbank, holding hands, reflecting on the journey that had brought them together. The night had reminded them that even the smallest gestures, like writing a note and lighting a lantern, could create lasting bonds and shared memories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walking home under the starry sky, the friends felt uplifted, grateful, and more connected than ever. The Night of Lanterns was more than a tradition—it was a celebration of friendship, hope, and the beautiful power of collective support, leaving everyone inspired to carry that light into their daily lives.
