      <p><strong>Part I: The Return</strong></p>

<p>The rain followed Nathan Rourke all the way back to Hollow’s End — the town he swore he’d never see again. The Rourke House stood at the edge of the hill, its windows boarded, roof sagging like a broken spine. He had inherited it after his father’s death, though no one in town dared approach it. Locals called it “The Dreaming House.”</p>

<p>Nathan was an architect now — practical, logical, immune to ghost stories. Yet when he crossed the threshold, his phone flickered out. The air was thick with the scent of damp wood and old memories. Dust hung like fog, and beneath it, the faint hum of something alive.</p>

<p>He began the restoration work alone. But at night, he heard faint knocking — not from the doors, but *inside the walls.* Sometimes whispers floated through the halls, calling his name the way his mother once did before she vanished, decades ago.</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The House That Waited</strong></p>

<p>In the study, Nathan found his father’s old blueprints — sketches of the house drawn with obsessive precision. Every room had notes beside it: “Dream cycle incomplete,” “Heart not aligned,” “Child’s room—unfinished.” The handwriting was his father’s, shaky and uneven, as if he had been mapping more than structure — perhaps consciousness.</p>

<p>One night, Nathan dreamed he was a boy again, running through the corridors, hearing his mother humming a lullaby from somewhere above. He followed the sound to the attic, but when he opened the door, it wasn’t his mother inside — it was himself, older, standing in front of the same blueprints, whispering, “Don’t wake it.”</p>

<p>He woke gasping, the echo of his own voice still in the air.</p>

<p><strong>Part III: The Hidden Room</strong></p>

<p>Driven by unease, Nathan re-examined the blueprints and noticed a missing chamber — a space that didn’t exist in the physical layout of the house. Between the master bedroom and the nursery, there was a wall too thick to be real. He tore through the plaster, revealing a hidden room painted entirely white, untouched by dust or time.</p>

<p>In the center stood a child’s bed. On it, a porcelain music box shaped like a heart. When he wound it, a soft melody began to play — his mother’s lullaby.</p>

<p>The floorboards creaked. The walls pulsed faintly. The air shimmered like breath. And in the reflection of the music box’s lid, Nathan saw a woman standing behind him — pale, gentle, eyes filled with longing. His mother. She reached out and whispered, “You finished it. Now let it rest.”</p>

<p>Before he could speak, the melody faltered, slowing, distorting — and the entire house seemed to exhale. The lights flickered, the floor trembled, and every door slammed shut at once. When silence returned, Nathan was alone. The bed was empty. The room was gone. Only the heart-shaped music box remained — cracked, still humming faintly.</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Awakening</strong></p>

<p>When morning came, workers arrived to find the house transformed — brighter, intact, as if rebuilt overnight. Nathan stood outside, exhausted but calm. “It’s finished,” he said softly. They thought he meant the restoration, but deep down he knew — the dream had finally ended.</p>

<p>Before leaving, he placed the music box on the windowsill. As he walked away, the faint sound of a lullaby drifted into the breeze — and for the first time, Hollow’s End slept peacefully.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The House That Dreamed</em> explores the haunting nature of memory — how guilt, grief, and longing can inhabit the spaces we build. It reminds us that not every ghost seeks revenge; some simply want release. Homes, like hearts, remember what they shelter. And sometimes, the only way to end a haunting is to finish the dream that began it. 🕯️🏚️</p>
