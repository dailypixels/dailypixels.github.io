        Kael had lived on the lighthouse cliff for nearly twenty years, tending to the light that guided ships safely to harbor. Storms were his companions, solitude his teacher. Many saw it as a lonely life, but for Kael, it was a privilege—to protect, to observe, and to understand the rhythm of the world.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One night, a violent storm approached. Waves crashed against jagged rocks, threatening vessels far below. Kael climbed the spiral stairs, lantern in hand, ensuring the great light would not falter. Hours passed, wind tearing at the walls, but he remained steady, a single soul keeping countless lives safe.  
      </p>
      <p>
        When dawn arrived, a fleet of ships had survived the storm. Fishermen and travelers would never know his name, but Kael smiled. True courage is quiet, unwavering, and often unseen. And in that silence, he found purpose and contentment.
