      <p>
        The wind screamed against the cliffs, tearing through the night like a wounded creature. Waves hurled themselves at the rocks below, white foam flashing under the restless beam of the lighthouse.

      <p>
        Elias, the lantern keeper, had lived here for twenty-three years. He no longer counted the storms. They were his only company—howling, relentless, familiar.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every evening, he climbed the spiral steps to light the great lens. He never knew if anyone saw it. Ships rarely passed this way now. But still, he kept it burning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tonight, though, the storm felt different. The air trembled with a strange rhythm, as if something vast and alive moved beyond the horizon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through the spyglass, he glimpsed it—a faint glimmer between waves. Not a ship’s light, but something smaller, pulsing like a heartbeat.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned the beam slightly, widening its reach. The storm roared in protest. Rain slammed against the windows, threatening to douse his flame. Elias shielded it with his coat, feeding the wick, refusing to let it die.
      </p>

      <p>
        Minutes stretched into hours. Then, from the dark, came an echoing horn—weak but real. A tiny fishing boat broke through the mist, tossed by waves, yet drawn to the light.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elias steadied the beam, guiding it toward the safe inlet below. When the boat finally reached the cove, he collapsed beside the lantern, breathless.
      </p>

      <p>
        At dawn, two fishermen knocked at the tower door. “We saw your light,” one said. “If it hadn’t been for you, we’d be gone with the sea.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Elias smiled faintly. For the first time in years, he realized the truth—his light had always mattered, even when unseen.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, when he climbed to the lantern room again, he didn’t just light the flame. He whispered to it, softly:
      </p>
      <p>“Let them find their way… and so will I.”</p>

      <h2>Meaning / Reflection:</h2>

      <p>
        Sometimes the things we do in silence—acts unseen, kindness unpraised—shine far beyond what we know. Even the smallest light can rescue someone lost in the dark, including ourselves.
