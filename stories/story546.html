        On a remote island battered by storms, Elias had kept the lighthouse for thirty years. Every night, he lit the beacon faithfully, even as ships grew fewer with modern navigation. Locals often teased that he was lighting the sea for no one.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Elias remembered his father’s words: *“A light is never wasted. Even one unseen keeps the promise alive.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        One night, a violent storm struck. The sea boiled black, the sky ripped with thunder. Elias kept the beacon burning, hands trembling as the winds howled around him. At dawn, wreckage washed ashore — not of a ship, but a lifeboat carrying a family, alive because they had seen a faint light through the storm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Word spread, and the villagers no longer mocked the keeper. Instead, they spoke of him as the man who proved that unseen devotion can still save lives. Elias never saw himself as a hero. He was only a man keeping a promise — a light burning for whoever might need it, even if they never knew his name.
