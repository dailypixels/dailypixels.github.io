      <p>
       For weeks, Daniel had walked to the same bridge before sunrise, not because he loved mornings, but because he didn’t know where else to go. Life felt heavier each day — bills piling up, relationships fraying, dreams shrinking into dust.
      </p>

      <p>
        That morning was colder than most. The river below looked like liquid steel, and the air burned his lungs. He leaned on the railing, staring at the dark horizon, wondering if anything waited for him beyond this endless stretch of exhaustion.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then, the first streak of light broke through the clouds. Not sudden, not dramatic — just a faint line of gold, steady and unshaken. It spread slowly, igniting the river until the whole surface shimmered like fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first time in months, Daniel felt something stir in him. Not a grand revelation, not a miracle — just a whisper: “Keep going. Just one more day.”
      </p>
<p>
He realized then that survival wasn’t about holding onto everything. It was about holding onto the smallest thread of light, trusting it enough to step forward.
</p>
<p>
When he finally walked back across the bridge, the city was waking up. Cars hummed, shopkeepers opened shutters, a child laughed at something only she could see. And Daniel thought: Maybe that’s enough. To see the light, and to start again.
</p>
<p>
The bridge became his ritual, not a place of despair, but of renewal. Every dawn reminded him — no night lasts forever.
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  The story shows that even when life feels unbearable, small glimpses of hope can give us the strength to continue. One step, one day, one sunrise at a time.
