     <p> The first light of dawn spilled across the narrow street, brushing the roofs with a sleepy gold. At the corner — between a shuttered bookstore and a cobbler’s shop — stood <em>Rehman’s Chai Point</em>. Nothing fancy: a wooden bench, a rusted kettle, and the hum of life beginning anew. </p> <p> Every morning, Rehman would arrive before sunrise, sweeping the dust, setting the cups, boiling water that whispered in rhythm with his thoughts. He’d worked that same spot for nearly twenty years, and somehow, he knew every face that passed — not by name, but by feeling. </p> <p> There was <em>Ali</em>, the schoolteacher who always read the newspaper before the children arrived. <em>Mrs. Farah</em>, who bought two cups every morning — one for herself, and one she left on the bench for her late husband. And <em>Samra</em>, the young artist who painted the sunrise every day, sipping slowly like she was tasting the color of the sky. </p> <p> Rehman never asked questions. He just poured tea, smiled, and listened — in silence. He’d learned long ago that people didn’t always need answers. Sometimes, they just needed warmth — in a cup, in a moment, in a familiar face. </p> <p> One cold morning, a stranger appeared. A young man, disheveled, lost in thought, with eyes that had forgotten how to rest. He ordered tea without looking up. Rehman poured it quietly, placing it before him. <br><br> The man took a sip and said softly, “It tastes… like home.” Rehman smiled. “Then you’ve come to the right place.” </p> <p> The stranger stayed for a while, returning each morning. He never said much, but one day he asked, “Why do you always smile at everyone, even when they’re rude or silent?” </p> <p> Rehman chuckled, stirring sugar into the pot. “Because,” he said, “every person who stops here is fighting a battle I can’t see. If my smile can help them forget it for one sip — then that’s reason enough.” </p> <p> The young man nodded. That morning, he left a note beneath his cup. When Rehman cleared the table later, he found it: <em>“You don’t just serve tea. You serve hope. — Thank you.”</em> </p> <p> Years passed. The street changed — new shops, new faces, new stories — but Rehman’s stall remained. Some days were busy, others quiet. And though time wore lines upon his face, his eyes still carried the same dawn. </p> <p> One morning, a little girl came running to his stall, clutching her father’s hand. “Baba,” she said, “this is the place you told me about — where the tea tastes like kindness.” Rehman smiled, pouring three cups this time. As the steam rose, he realized — his small corner of the world had become something larger than he’d ever imagined. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Tea Stall at Dawn* is a quiet celebration of everyday life — of strangers becoming stories, and small gestures carrying unseen healing. It reminds us that meaning doesn’t always come from big changes or distant dreams; sometimes, it’s waiting in the warmth of a shared cup, a gentle word, or a smile at sunrise. ☕🌅 </p>
