      <p>
        It all started with a wobbly shopping cart.  
        You know the kind—the one that rattles loudly  
        and insists on veering left even if you’re just trying  
        to buy some milk.  
      </p>

      <p>
        My plan was simple: grab a few groceries,  
        get out in fifteen minutes.  
        But the cart had other plans.  
        The moment I let go to pick up a box of cereal,  
        it took off down the aisle like it was auditioning  
        for the Indy 500.
      </p>

      <p>
        I chased after it, dodging a display of stacked  
        soup cans (which wobbled dangerously)  
        and apologizing to an elderly lady  
        who was now clutching her handbag  
        like I was part of a heist.  
        The cart made a sharp turn at frozen foods,  
        nearly taking out a poor man choosing ice cream.  
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time I caught it, panting and slightly mortified,  
        a group of amused employees had gathered,  
        one holding up their phone,  
        clearly recording my “race.”  
        The crowd even clapped as I wheeled the rebellious cart  
        back to my aisle of shame.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Moral of the story?  
        Never underestimate a runaway grocery cart.  
        And maybe, just maybe,  
        bring a list next time so you’re not  
        running through the store  
        like you’re in a reality TV competition.
