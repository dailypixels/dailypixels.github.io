      <p>
        Sophie and Maya had been inseparable since college. When Sophie’s father fell ill, her world felt as if it were collapsing. She withdrew, overwhelmed by worry and fear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maya refused to leave her side. She brought meals, shared quiet evenings, and reminded Sophie to take a breath and find light amidst darkness. One evening, they attended a local lantern festival, each holding a paper lantern.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sophie hesitated, her lantern trembling in her hands. Maya smiled, saying, “We lift each other up, even when the world feels heavy.” Together, they released the lanterns into the sky, watching them drift higher, carrying wishes, hope, and strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sophie realized that friendship wasn’t just about being present for the joyful moments—it was about holding each other steady when life’s storms threatened to pull them under.  
        The glowing lanterns mirrored the light their bond had always carried, illuminating paths even in the darkest nights.
