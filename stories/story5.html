    <main class="story-content">
      <p> The studio smelled of dust and time. **Alyssa Trent** adjusted her headset, flicked the recorder on, and whispered into the microphone, “This is *Echo Hour*, and tonight’s guest... is a voice from the past.” </p> <p> Across from her sat an empty chair. But the headphones began to hum, and a low, familiar voice came through — “Hello, Alyssa. It’s been a while.” </p> <p> Her hand froze. That voice belonged to **Nathan Cole**, the war correspondent who vanished in Syria ten years ago — her mentor, and once, the man she loved. </p> <p> She swallowed hard. “Nathan... is that really you?” A soft chuckle followed. “Depends. Do you believe what you can’t explain?” </p> <p> For the next twenty minutes, she asked everything she had buried for a decade — why he left, what happened in the desert, why he never said goodbye. Nathan spoke calmly, each word echoing like memory through glass. “I stayed because the truth had to be told,” he said. “But truth has a cost, Alyssa. You of all people know that.” </p> <p> Tears welled up as she whispered, “Was it worth it?” A long pause. Then, “It’s only worth it if someone listens.” </p> <p> The line crackled. She reached out — “Nathan?” Silence. Only the faint hum of old static filled the room. </p> <p> When she looked at the recorder, the tape was blank. No voice. No sound. Only her own questions echoing back. </p> <p> Later that night, she walked home beneath the city lights. The radio in a nearby café played a familiar tone — Nathan’s voice, calm and steady: “This is Nathan Cole, signing off — for one last truth.” </p> <p> Alyssa stopped in her tracks, tears falling freely now. She whispered to the night, “I heard you.” </p> <p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Interview That Never Aired* explores how memory speaks long after voices fade. Some conversations never happen out loud — yet they still change us. Sometimes, the interview isn’t about answers — it’s about finally listening to what silence has been saying all along. 🎧 </p>
