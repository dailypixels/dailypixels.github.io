      <p>
        When I first met Professor Idris, he was eighty-two years old and still teaching three days a week at a small community school. His students ranged from children struggling with literacy to adults preparing for late-career exams. He sat behind a desk piled with notebooks and chalk, his voice steady but eyes burning with curiosity.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Teaching is not about what I give,” he said during our interview. “It’s about what I continue to learn alongside them.” He gestured toward the students outside the window, laughing during their lunch break. “They change every year. If I don’t keep learning, how can I meet them where they are?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Idris’s story began in a remote village, where his first classroom was under a banyan tree. With only one book and ten children, he improvised lessons using sticks in the dirt. Decades later, his methods had changed—computers, projectors, online resources—but his philosophy remained the same: respect the learner, and you’ll earn the privilege of teaching them.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the interview deepened, he confessed to moments of exhaustion, of wanting to retire, of hearing whispers that “his time had passed.” But each time he considered leaving, a student’s progress pulled him back. One illiterate grandmother who learned to read at sixty. A boy who once failed every exam but later became a lawyer. A young refugee girl who cried during her first lesson but went on to write poetry in a new language. “How could I walk away from that?” he asked, tears welling.
      </p>

      <p>
        His greatest pride wasn’t in awards or recognition, but in the way former students returned, often years later, to thank him. They would bring their children, sometimes even grandchildren, introducing them to “the man who never stopped believing in us.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When the interview ended, Professor Idris closed his notebook and smiled. “People think old age means the end of learning. But I tell my students every day: the mind doesn’t retire unless you let it.”
