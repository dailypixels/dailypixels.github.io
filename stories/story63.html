     <p><em>Spring</em><br> She came with the wind — laughing, reckless, hair full of sunlight. He was a writer without words, his notebook empty, his hands unsure of warmth. When she smiled, the ink finally moved. When she left, it froze again. He thought love was something you write. She taught him it’s something you breathe. And so, for one spring, they shared a sky — not knowing skies can change too. </p> <p><em>Summer</em><br> They walked the city streets barefoot, counting hours by laughter, not clocks. She painted stars on their apartment ceiling so that even sleep would feel like flying. He promised forever — not realizing forever is a season, too. When the rains came, she whispered, “Don’t write me as if I’ll last. Write me as if I’m real.” And he did. He wrote her until the pages tore. </p> <p><em>Autumn</em><br> The days grew heavy with silence. Coffee cups stayed half-full. Her laughter became a photograph, and his pen trembled between words like <em>“stay”</em> and <em>“go.”</em> When she left, the door didn’t close — it sighed. And the sky, once so vast, became a ceiling he could no longer touch. </p> <p><em>Winter</em><br> Years passed quietly. The bench under the jacaranda grew old, its paint faded, its stories softened by rain. He returned one twilight, not to wait, but to remember. He opened the same notebook — the ink had bled, the words half-erased, but one line still lived: *“If love leaves, let it leave the light on.”* </p> <p><em>Spring Again</em><br> A breeze, a scent, a sound — and there she was, only older, softer, eyes full of the years they’d lost. Neither spoke. The sky, patient all this time, opened wide — as if to say, “You made it back.” And somewhere, between laughter and silence, they began again — not to rewrite, but to finally live the story they’d only written. </p>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Sky That Waited* is a poetic reflection on time, loss, and the quiet constancy of love. Seasons change, faces age, memories fade — but the sky, like the heart, remembers everything. It reminds us that love isn’t something to keep — it’s something to return to, again and again, until it feels like home. ☁️💙 </p>
