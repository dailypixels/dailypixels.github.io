        Mondays were already bad enough, but when Liam’s alarm didn’t go off, 
        his morning spiraled into chaos. He sprinted out of bed, 
        mismatched socks barely clinging to his feet, and raced to make coffee.  
        The problem was—Liam wasn’t exactly awake yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        He poured water into the coffee machine, forgetting to put the pot underneath.  
        By the time he realized, a river of steaming coffee cascaded across the counter 
        like molten lava. His cat, Muffin, meowed indignantly as it leapt out of the way, 
        knocking over a cereal box that exploded across the floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cursing under his breath, Liam grabbed a towel—only to step directly 
        into the spilled cereal. Cornflakes clung to his socks as if mocking him.  
        That was when the doorbell rang.
      </p>

      <p>
        He opened the door to find his boss, Ms. Turner, standing there, holding a file.  
        “Since you didn’t answer your phone, I thought I’d drop this off.”  
        Her eyes widened at the sight: coffee dripping from the counter, 
        cereal sticking to Liam’s clothes, and Muffin triumphantly perched 
        on top of the fridge like a furry king.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Rough morning?” she asked, struggling not to laugh.  
        “You could say that,” Liam muttered, brushing flakes off his shirt.  
        “Well,” she said, handing him the file, “at least you’re fully… caffeinated.”  
        Then she smirked and walked away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liam looked back at the chaos of his kitchen and burst out laughing.  
        Maybe Mondays weren’t cursed. Maybe they were just a comedy show 
        he hadn’t realized he was starring in.
