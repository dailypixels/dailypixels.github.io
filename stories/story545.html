        Miguel, a retired composer, spent his mornings in a garden no one visited. Around him hung pages of sheet music, pinned to branches and fences, each one carrying melodies he had never finished. Birds perched among the notes as though they too were trying to sing them into life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neighbors thought it strange until a young violinist wandered in one afternoon. She picked up a sheet, played a few measures, and filled the air with trembling beauty. Miguel wept. “They were never meant to be heard,” he confessed. She shook her head. “All songs are meant to be heard, even if unfinished.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, others joined — singers, children with makeshift drums, pianists with keyboards balanced on knees. The garden became a place where incomplete music was not a failure but an invitation. Miguel no longer hid his half-written notes. He gave them freely, letting others finish the songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The garden blossomed, not with perfect compositions but with shared voices. In the harmony of imperfection, Miguel found the one symphony he had always searched for: community.
