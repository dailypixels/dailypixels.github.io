      <p>
        Monday morning. Ethan had decided that this would finally be the week he became one of those people — the kind who woke up early, meditated, made perfect coffee, and started work with serene focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step one went well: he actually got out of bed at six. Step two? Ten minutes of meditation that mostly involved him wondering if he was doing it wrong. But still, progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came the coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        He carefully ground the beans, heated the water, and poured with the precision of a scientist. The aroma was heavenly. He smiled to himself. “This is it. New me.”
      </p>
<p>
Except when he reached for his mug, his sleeve caught the handle. In one graceful motion, the mug tipped, coffee cascaded across the desk, drowned his keyboard, and splattered onto the important documents he had laid out.
</p>
<p>
Ethan froze, staring at the disaster. His cat chose that exact moment to leap onto the desk, pawing through the mess like it was a new playground.
</p>
<p>
By the time he’d cleaned up, his meditation app was chiming cheerfully: “Don’t forget to breathe!”
</p>
<p>
Ethan laughed, despite himself. The perfect morning was ruined, but somehow, he felt lighter. The pressure to have everything “just right” had spilled away with the coffee.
</p>
<p>
Later, when he logged into work from his backup laptop, his coworkers asked how his morning had been.
</p>
<p>
He grinned and said, “Perfect. Absolutely perfect.”
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  Life doesn’t need to be flawless to be meaningful. Sometimes the mess, the accidents, and the laughter that follows are what make ordinary days worth remembering.
