      <p>The house stood alone on the hill — half-covered in vines, half-swallowed by silence. Inside, <strong>Sahir Abbas</strong>, once Pakistan’s most celebrated director, sat waiting with a cup of cold tea.</p>

<p>When <strong>Aisha Karim</strong> arrived, recorder in hand, she felt a nervous respect. She’d grown up watching his films — the kind that made you ache quietly after the credits. He hadn’t given an interview in <strong>fifteen years.</strong></p>

<p><em>“Let’s talk about your last movie,”</em> she began softly. <em>“The one you never finished.”</em></p>

<p>Sahir smiled faintly. “Ah, <em>The River Without End.</em> You’ve done your homework.” He leaned back, eyes drifting to the window. “It was supposed to be a love story. Two people meeting on opposite sides of a river every spring — until one year, the river doesn’t thaw.”</p>

<p>She clicked her pen. <em>“Why didn’t you finish it?”</em></p>

<p>He hesitated. “Because she didn’t return.”</p>

<p>Aisha frowned. <em>“The actress?”</em></p>

<p>He nodded slowly. “My wife. She was my muse — my reason to tell stories. The day she disappeared, the river scene was being filmed. I told myself I’d wait until she came back to finish it.” He looked at the recorder. “And I kept waiting.”</p>

<p>Silence stretched between them, deep and fragile. Aisha whispered, “Maybe the movie wasn’t meant to end — maybe it <em>is</em> your story.”</p>

<p>For the first time, Sahir smiled — a real, unguarded one. “Perhaps,” he said. “And maybe today, it finally ends.”</p>

<p>He reached across the table and stopped the recorder himself.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Aisha returned to deliver the interview notes, the caretaker told her: <em>“He passed away in his sleep. Peaceful. Smiling.”</em></p>

<p>When she played the recording again that night, she noticed something new — a faint sound at the end. A woman’s laughter, blending softly with the rustle of the wind.</p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection:</h2>

<p>
  Sometimes, the story we’re trying to capture already ended — and all we can do is listen to what remains between the words.
