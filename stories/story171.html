        Years had passed since Emma left her hometown for college, leaving her high school sweetheart, Liam, behind. Letters exchanged in the first months slowly dwindled, and eventually, life moved them apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        One snowy December evening, Emma returned for the holiday festival. Nostalgia guided her steps to the town square, where the festive lights illuminated the familiar streets. And there he was—Liam, placing the last ornament on the giant pine tree.

        Their eyes met, hesitation melting into recognition, then joy. Words weren’t needed; the warmth in their gaze conveyed years of love, longing, and forgiveness. They walked together under the snowflakes, hands brushing until fingers intertwined.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the festival’s center, Liam took Emma’s hand and whispered, “I never stopped waiting for you.” Emma smiled through tears, replying, “And I never stopped coming back.”  
        Surrounded by laughter, music, and softly falling snow, they embraced, feeling time collapse and hearts reunite.
