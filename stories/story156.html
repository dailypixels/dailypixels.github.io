     <p><strong>Part I: The Frequency</strong></p>

<p>It was nearing midnight when Sam Vickers leaned back in his creaking chair at the Blackwater County Radio Station. The old transmitter tower whined softly against the wind. Outside, fog rolled in from the marshlands, swallowing the road and the world beyond.</p>

<p>He sipped stale coffee and adjusted the frequency knob. Static hissed. The night was quiet — too quiet — until a voice broke through the noise.</p>

<p><em>“Mayday… this is Blackwater Bridge. Can anyone hear me?”</em></p>

<p>Sam froze. Blackwater Bridge had been condemned since 1982. Torn apart by a flood. There were no transmitters, no power lines, nothing left standing.</p>

<p>“This is Station 91,” he replied cautiously. “Who is this?”</p>

<p>A crackle, then silence. Then the voice again — faint, urgent, female. <em>“He’s coming back. Please, you have to listen. Don’t let him cross the bridge.”</em></p>

<p>Static swallowed the words. Sam sat there staring at the transmitter, his heartbeat ticking louder than the clock on the wall.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part II: The Coordinates</strong></p>

<p>The next morning, Sam replayed the recording. The signal was weak, but he traced the source — 47.961° N, 119.204° W — the exact location of Blackwater Bridge.</p>

<p>Against his better judgment, he drove out there at dusk. The road was half-swallowed by mist and moss. When he reached the bridge, it was nothing more than rotting planks and rusted railings over a dead riverbed.</p>

<p>But his handheld radio crackled to life the moment he stepped out of the truck.</p>

<p><em>“You shouldn’t be here, Sam.”</em></p>

<p>He spun around. “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>Silence — except for the wind whistling through the steel bones of the bridge. Then: <em>“He’s almost here.”</em></p>

<p>The frequency dipped. For a moment, Sam thought he saw someone — a flicker of a figure standing at the far end of the bridge — then gone.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part III: The Man in the Flood</strong></p>

<p>That night, Sam couldn’t sleep. He dug through the station’s archives and found an old report: “Blackwater Bridge Collapse — March 12, 1982.”</p>

<p>It mentioned two names — *Eleanor Reeves*, the woman who sent the distress call, and *Deputy Charles Vickers* — Sam’s father.</p>

<p>His blood ran cold.</p>

<p>The article said his father had gone to rescue a stranded driver that night. Both had vanished when the bridge gave way. But the driver’s name had never been found.</p>

<p>Sam’s hands shook as the radio buzzed again — 12:03 a.m., the exact time the bridge fell.</p>

<p><em>“He’s back, Sam. Don’t answer him.”</em></p>

<p>Then another voice came through — low, familiar, distorted. <em>“Son? It’s me. I need you to cross.”</em></p>

<p>Sam’s breath hitched. “Dad?”</p>

<p><em>“Please. I’ve been waiting. Just one step closer.”</em></p>

<p>Through the window, headlights flared on the foggy road. Someone — or something — was standing on the bridge again.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Crossing</strong></p>

<p>He grabbed his flashlight and gun, heart hammering as he drove back. The bridge loomed like a scar in the night. His radio screamed with overlapping voices — <em>“Don’t!”</em> — <em>“Help me!”</em> — <em>“Cross!”</em> — a cacophony of time and memory.</p>

<p>At the center of the bridge stood his father — or what was left of him. His eyes glowed faintly, his skin pale like river silt. The air smelled of rust and wet stone.</p>

<p>“You came,” the figure said. “Now finish what I started.”</p>

<p>Sam raised the flashlight. “You’re not him.”</p>

<p>The figure smiled — hollow, knowing. “Neither are you… not yet.”</p>

<p>The boards beneath Sam groaned. The mist thickened. The bridge began to tremble — as if awakening after decades of sleep.</p>

<p>He turned to run. The last thing he saw was the jarred glimmer of his father’s badge sinking through the planks before everything went black.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part V: The Broadcast</strong></p>

<p>At dawn, the sheriff’s department found his truck abandoned by the riverbank. No footprints. No body.</p>

<p>Back at Station 91, the morning operator came in to relieve the night shift. The radio was on — open channel, repeating the same message in Sam’s voice:</p>

<p><em>“This is Blackwater Bridge… can anyone hear me?”</em></p>

<p>The signal still plays at midnight. Every night.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Signal Under Blackwater Bridge</em> explores the fine line between grief and obsession — how the voices we chase from the past can consume us if we don’t let them rest. Sometimes, the call we answer isn’t from the living… but from what we refuse to bury. 📻🌫️</p>
