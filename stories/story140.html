     <p><strong>Part I: The Noise in the Night</strong></p>

<p>It started with the tapping.</p>

<p>At first, Elise thought it was the pipes — the old building on Marrow Street was notorious for strange sounds. But this was different. Every night at exactly 2:17 a.m., she heard a faint tapping on the wall that separated her apartment from 412 — slow, deliberate, like someone sending a message in code.</p>

<p>Apartment 412 had been empty for months. The last tenant, an older man named Mr. Halden, had moved out suddenly after his wife’s death. Or at least, that’s what the landlord said.</p>

<p>But one morning, Elise noticed something odd — a faint glow under the door of 412. A shadow moved behind the frosted glass window. She froze, listening. Then came the tapping again. Three knocks. A pause. Three more.</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The New Tenant</strong></p>

<p>The next day, she asked the landlord about it. “Oh, right,” he said, avoiding her eyes. “Someone new moved in last week. Didn’t want much fuss.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” she pressed.</p>

<p>“Uh… Mr. Halden,” the landlord muttered.</p>

<p>Elise frowned. “But that was the last tenant’s name.”</p>

<p>He shrugged. “Coincidence, I guess.”</p>

<p>That night, she couldn’t sleep. The tapping started again — louder this time. She placed her ear to the wall and whispered, “Who are you?”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Then, faintly: three knocks. A pause. Then two.</p>

<p>She wrote the pattern down, realizing it was Morse code. She looked it up online. It spelled one word: <em>HELP.</em></p>

<p><strong>Part III: The Discovery</strong></p>

<p>Elise’s curiosity turned to dread. The next morning, she noticed muddy footprints in the hallway outside 412 — but no one ever entered or left. She decided to wait by her peephole that night.</p>

<p>At 2:00 a.m., the hallway light flickered. A shadow stopped at the door of 412. The man wore a dark coat, his face hidden beneath the brim of a hat. He didn’t use a key. The door simply opened. He stepped inside, and the light above him went out.</p>

<p>Elise’s heart pounded. She grabbed her phone and called the police, reporting a possible break-in. By the time they arrived, the hallway was empty. Apartment 412 was locked from the inside. When the officers forced it open, the room was dark — empty except for dust, an overturned chair, and a faint handprint on the windowpane.</p>

<p>“No one’s lived here in over a year,” one of the officers said. “You must’ve heard the wind.”</p>

<p>Elise pointed at the footprints. “And those?”</p>

<p>The officer knelt, touching them. “These aren’t fresh. They’ve been here for days.”</p>

<p>After they left, Elise sat awake until morning, staring at the wall. No more tapping. Only silence — heavy, watchful silence.</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Truth Behind the Wall</strong></p>

<p>Two days later, she couldn’t take it anymore. She went to the archives at the city library, searching for anything about the building’s history. There she found an article from 2023 — *“Man Found Dead in Apartment 412: Wife Missing.”* The photo showed Mr. Halden, smiling faintly, standing beside a woman whose eyes looked eerily familiar. The report said he’d been found in his chair, weeks after dying of a heart attack. No one ever found the wife’s body.</p>

<p>Elise stared at the article until her hands trembled. The tapping. The code. <em>HELP.</em></p>

<p>She rushed home. The hallway was dark again, the bulb above 412 flickering. As she passed the door, she stopped — the air smelled faintly of old perfume. Her hand brushed the doorknob. It was warm.</p>

<p>The door creaked open on its own.</p>

<p>Inside, the room looked untouched — except now there was a single chair facing the wall. On the wall, scratched into the plaster, were the same Morse code symbols she’d written down. Beneath them, one final word: <em>FOUND.</em></p>

<p>Elise turned to run, but the door slammed shut. The light flickered once. Twice. Then everything went dark.</p>

<p><strong>Part V: Apartment 413</strong></p>

<p>Weeks later, the landlord placed another “For Rent” sign on Apartment 413. A new tenant, a young man named Caleb, moved in. On his first night, he noticed something strange — faint tapping from the wall beside him. He pressed his ear against it and frowned.</p>

<p>Three knocks. A pause. Three more.</p>

<p>He didn’t know that the apartment next door — 412 — had been sealed off since the night Elise disappeared.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Man in Apartment 412</em> explores how curiosity can blur the line between truth and terror. It reminds us that some mysteries aren’t meant to be solved — and that silence can sometimes hide the loudest cries for help. In every locked door, there’s a story waiting — but not every story wants to be found. 🕯️🚪</p>
