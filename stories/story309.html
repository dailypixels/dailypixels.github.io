      <p>
        Maya stood at the edge of the rickety wooden bridge. Beneath it lay a valley cloaked in mist, stretching so far down that she could barely see the river below. On the other side, sunlight lit the path to a village where she had been offered her first teaching job.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fear rooted her to the spot. She had grown up in hardship, doubted by many, and told she was too fragile to chase her dreams. Now, this bridge felt like all those doubts made real—shaking under her weight, daring her to turn back.
      </p>

      <p>
        She remembered her late father’s words: “Every bridge you cross takes you closer to the person you’re meant to be. Don’t fear the steps—fear standing still.” Taking a breath, Maya stepped forward. The boards groaned, the ropes swayed, but each step brought her nearer to the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time she reached the far bank, tears blurred her vision—not from fear, but from pride. She realized the bridge had never been about wood and rope. It was about faith in herself. For the first time, she believed she could carry her own dreams across any valley life placed before her.
      </p>

      <p>
        The children who welcomed her in the village would never know the fear she had carried across that bridge. But every lesson she taught them carried the invisible truth: courage is not the absence of fear—it is the decision to keep walking despite it.
