        The city marathon was Daniel’s dream. For years, he trained at dawn, pounding pavement while the world slept.  
        On race day, the crowd roared, banners waved, and Daniel felt invincible.
      </p>

      <p>
        At mile fifteen, his foot caught a crack. He fell hard, knees scraping the asphalt. Runners sped past, sympathy flashing in their eyes.  
        Daniel’s body screamed for him to quit. His pride whispered the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he remembered his daughter’s words: *“Dad, even heroes fall. But they always get back up.”*  
        With tears mixing with sweat, Daniel rose. One step, then another. The pain was sharp, but his will sharper.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours later, he stumbled across the finish line—not first, not fast, but victorious. The crowd erupted, not for the winner, but for the man who refused to stay down.  
        His daughter ran to him, arms wide, shouting: “You did it, Dad!”
      </p>

      <p>
        That day, Daniel learned that true victory isn’t measured by time or medals, but by the courage to rise when you fall.
