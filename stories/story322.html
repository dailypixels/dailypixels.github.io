      <p>
        In the kingdom of Eryndor, fire had died. For generations, the world lay in frost, the people surviving by memory alone. Then came Kael, a wanderer who carried in his palm a single ember that never went out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rumors spread—some called him savior, others cursed him as a thief of forbidden magic. But Kael sought neither crown nor worship. He sought the Flamekeeper’s Shrine, a ruined temple said to awaken fire’s return.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along his path, he faced wolves of ice, spirits of ash, and his own doubt. Each time the ember flickered, he shielded it with his bare hands, burning himself to protect its glow. “As long as it burns,” he whispered, “hope is not lost.”
      </p>

      <p>
        At the shrine, he placed the ember upon the altar. Flames erupted, chasing the frost from the valleys. The people wept—not for Kael’s heroism, but for the reminder that even the smallest light can end the longest night.
