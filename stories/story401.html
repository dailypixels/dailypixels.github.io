        The Grand City Library was more than books—it was a monument of memory. Generations had read under its chandeliers, their whispers blending with the rustle of parchment. But during the fire of 1899, much of the library was destroyed, leaving only ashes and rumors of what had been lost.  
      </p>

      <p>
        A century later, Adeel, a young historian, uncovered an untouched basement hidden beneath the new reconstructed library. There he found charred manuscripts, still smelling faintly of smoke, and journals belonging to the original librarian, Madame Celeste.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The journals told a different history: the fire hadn’t been an accident. It had been deliberate. Certain books—ones documenting the city’s corruption and forbidden alliances—had been targeted to vanish. Celeste had hidden duplicates deep underground, hoping someday the truth would resurface.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading by lantern light, Adeel realized he held centuries of secrets in his hands. But he faced a choice: publish them and risk chaos in the present—or keep them hidden, as Celeste once had, preserving fragile peace. His silence or his voice would both shape history anew.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, the ashes of the past still burn in the future.
