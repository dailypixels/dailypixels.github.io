        It had been years since Lila and Ethan parted ways, each caught in the currents of life and unspoken regrets. One rainy evening, a chance encounter brought them face-to-face under the soft glow of street lamps. Lila clutched her umbrella, heart thundering, as Ethan smiled sheepishly from across the street.

        Words failed them at first; the rain seemed to echo the distance that had grown between them. But as they walked together under a single umbrella, memories flowed freely—shared laughter, stolen glances, promises whispered in the dark. The storm around them felt like a curtain lifting, revealing what had never truly been lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I thought I’d lost you forever,” Ethan confessed, voice trembling. Lila reached for his hand, squeezing gently, “We were never lost, just… waiting for this moment.” Time seemed to pause as they leaned closer, raindrops tracing paths on their faces like tiny reminders of all the years passed.
      </p>

        Under the rain, the city felt still. Every puddle reflected their faces, every raindrop whispered the truth—they were meant to find each other again. That night, Lila and Ethan rediscovered a love resilient enough to endure distance, silence, and heartache. And as the rain subsided, a new chapter began, tender, hopeful, and undeniably theirs.
