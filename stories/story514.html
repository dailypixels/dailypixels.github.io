        In 1857, as colonial unrest shook the subcontinent, a young painter named Kareem walked through the narrow streets of Lahore carrying a satchel of brushes and pigment stones. He had been commissioned to capture the fading Mughal gardens before they were transformed into British cantonments.

      <p>
        With every stroke, Kareem painted more than flowers and fountains—he painted memory. His canvases preserved not just the architecture but the rhythm of bazaars, the colors of wedding processions, and the whispers of poets who still gathered under arches to recite verses.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the commission was not neutral. The colonial officer wanted these paintings cataloged as “ruins of an outdated culture.” Kareem refused. Instead, he smuggled his true work—vivid, defiant portraits of a city alive—into the homes of families who understood their worth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Decades later, when Lahore’s gardens were scarred by modern roads, Kareem’s hidden paintings resurfaced. They became a quiet rebellion, a reminder that even when history is rewritten, art remembers the truth.
