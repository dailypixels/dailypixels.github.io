      <p><strong>Aliya:</strong> How do you find so much patience with these plants?</p>
      <p><strong>Mr. Iqbal:</strong> Plants teach me that growth is silent. You water them, you care, you wait. Nature does the rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Aliya:</strong> What’s the most important lesson the garden has taught you?</p>
      <p><strong>Mr. Iqbal:</strong> Life is seasonal. Some things bloom, others rest. You can’t force growth, but you can nurture it.</p>

      <p><strong>Aliya:</strong> And your advice for people facing challenges?</p>
      <p><strong>Mr. Iqbal:</strong> Be like the soil—support, hold, absorb, and stay patient. Challenges pass, and growth always happens.</p>

      <p>
        Sitting among the flowers, Aliya realized that wisdom isn’t always loud. Sometimes it is quiet, like sunlight on petals, shaping lives gently but surely.
