        It was tucked between the pages of an old novel—yellowed at the edges, folded neatly, and addressed in familiar handwriting.  
        I hadn’t seen her in years, but the moment I touched that envelope, I was back in that little apartment with the leaky windows and lavender curtains.
      </p>

      <p>
        My hands trembled as I opened it. Her words spilled out like whispers from the past:  
        *“If you’re reading this, I hope you still smile at sunflowers. I hope you still take the long way home,  
        even when it rains. And I hope you know I loved you, even when I couldn’t find the courage to say it out loud.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        A soft laugh escaped me. She always knew how to write like poetry without trying.  
        I read the letter three times, each word digging up memories:  
        late-night talks over tea, our record player crackling with old songs,  
        and her dancing barefoot in the kitchen like nobody was watching.
      </p>

      <p>
        I tucked the letter back into the book, tears blurring the words.  
        There was no address to write back to, no phone number to call.  
        But something about finding her words now, after all these years, felt like fate.  
        She was still here, in every sunflower, every rainy walk, every quiet corner of my heart.
      </p>

        Love doesn’t always stay in the way we expect it to.  
        Sometimes it lingers like a melody—soft, invisible, but impossible to forget.  
        And as I closed the book, I whispered into the empty room,  
        “I loved you too.”
