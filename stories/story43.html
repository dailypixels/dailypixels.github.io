      <p> You looked up, and I did too — two worlds apart, but beneath the same breath of heaven. <br><br> There are distances the heart cannot measure, not in miles, not in days, but in the pauses where your name would have been. </p> <p> Every night, I trace constellations like maps of memory. Orion, Cassiopeia, the Archer — they all point toward you somehow. <br><br> Sometimes, I think the stars are windows where lost words go to rest. Sometimes, I think they’re you — still trying to reach me through light that left centuries ago. </p> <p> We once promised to meet “where the sky touches the sea.” But the horizon is a liar — it never lets them touch, only lets them ache for one another. <br><br> Maybe that’s what love is — two souls forever almost meeting. </p> <p> I remember your last letter. You wrote: *“If you ever feel lonely, look up — I’ll be looking too.”* So I do. Every night. And sometimes, when the wind hums softly, I swear I hear your laughter folded into it, a note of warmth in the cold of distance. </p> <p> The world has changed. Cities blink with neon stars, and real ones hide behind smoke. But when I close my eyes, I still see your light. Not blazing — just steady. Like a lantern waiting at the end of a long road. </p> <p> If I could write the sky a letter, I’d ask it to bend — just once — to let our shadows touch. But perhaps it already has. Perhaps when night falls in your world, it’s because day is kneeling in mine. </p> <p> And maybe this — this soft ache, this quiet reaching — is the truest form of love. <br><br> Not the one that shouts across distances, but the one that whispers beneath them, patiently, endlessly — until silence becomes prayer. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Sky Between Us* is a poem about **connection beyond distance** — how love, when it is real, doesn’t fade with absence; it transforms into something quieter, deeper, and more eternal. <br><br> It reminds us that even when people drift apart, the sky above remains shared — a silent witness to the constellations we once built together. 🌌✨ </p>
