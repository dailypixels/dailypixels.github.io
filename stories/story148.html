      <p><strong>Part I: The Move-In</strong></p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when Clara Reed carried the last box into Apartment 9B. The hallway smelled faintly of bleach and old paint, and somewhere in the distance, a faucet dripped with irregular rhythm. She’d taken the place because it was cheap — too cheap for the heart of the city. “Old buildings have character,” the landlord had said. But this one had something else entirely.</p>

<p>When she turned on the kitchen light, it flickered three times before holding steady. On the counter lay a single key — old, brass, and not hers. The tag read simply: *Basement.*</p>

<p>“I’m not dealing with that tonight,” she muttered, tossing it into a drawer. She unpacked a few things, made some tea, and tried to settle in. But as she drifted off on the couch, she heard it — the sound of footsteps directly above her. Slow, deliberate, dragging. Except… there was no Apartment 10B. The top floor ended with hers.</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The Whispering Walls</strong></p>

<p>Over the next week, strange things began to happen. Her coffee mugs changed places overnight. The lights in the bathroom would flicker whenever she entered. Sometimes, faint whispers seeped through the vents — words she couldn’t quite make out, though one phrase came clearer each time: “Don’t go below.”</p>

<p>Clara mentioned it to the building manager, but he only smiled thinly. “Old pipes. Don’t let the place get to you.”</p>

<p>But the building <em>did</em> get to her. One evening, when she returned from work, she found her front door unlocked. Inside, the living room rug had been rolled back, revealing a trapdoor she swore hadn’t been there before. In its metal ring sat the brass key marked *Basement.*</p>

<p>Her pulse quickened. “No,” she whispered. “No way.” But curiosity — that dangerous human weakness — won again.</p>

<p><strong>Part III: The Basement Below</strong></p>

<p>The trapdoor led to a narrow stairwell descending into darkness. Each step groaned under her weight. The air grew colder, damper. She turned on her phone’s flashlight, revealing concrete walls covered in old, faded newspaper clippings — all of them about missing tenants from this same building.</p>

<p>Then she saw it: a door at the end of the hall, half-open, light spilling from within. On it, someone had carved “9B.”</p>

<p>Clara’s breath caught. The door creaked open further on its own, revealing a mirror image of her apartment — same furniture, same photos — except everything was coated in a thin layer of dust. Her voice trembled. “What is this?”</p>

<p>In the reflection of the dusty mirror on the wall, she saw movement. A shape. A figure standing just behind her. She spun around — nothing. But when she looked back at the mirror, the shadow was still there, smiling.</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Shadow’s Truth</strong></p>

<p>She fled up the stairs, slamming the trapdoor shut and locking it. The whispers followed her now — louder, pleading. “You were never supposed to find it.”</p>

<p>That night, she didn’t sleep. Every few minutes, she swore she saw movement in the corners of her vision. Finally, at 3:14 a.m., she opened her laptop and searched the building’s name. The results made her blood run cold.</p>

<p>In 1985, there had been a fire in Apartment 9B. The tenant — a woman named Clara Reed — was never found. Declared dead. The building had been abandoned for decades before its recent renovation.</p>

<p>Her hands shook as she reached for the mirror on her wall. The same mirror from the basement apartment. She touched the glass — and her reflection smiled a moment before she did.</p>

<p><strong>Part V: The Final Tenant</strong></p>

<p>When the building manager entered 9B the next morning, he found it empty. No boxes, no furniture, no trace of anyone ever living there. Only a faint handprint on the mirror and a brass key resting on the floor.</p>

<p>He sighed, pocketed the key, and whispered into the empty air, “Welcome home, Clara.”</p>

<p>The lights flickered once — then went out.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Shadow in Apartment 9B</em> explores the thin boundary between memory and existence. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the things we fear most are the echoes of ourselves — the lives we left unfinished, the stories that never learned how to end. 🕯️</p>
