      <p>
        Finn and Mateo had been inseparable since they met as young volunteers at the coastal lighthouse.  
        Years later, they still returned to keep the light shining for passing ships, maintaining a tradition that was more than just duty—it was their bond.
      </p>

      <p>
        One stormy evening, the light faltered, and waves crashed fiercely against the rocks.  
        Working side by side, the friends repaired the machinery, encouraging each other to stay calm despite the raging storm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exhausted but triumphant, they watched the lighthouse beam cut through the darkness, guiding sailors safely home.  
        In that moment, they realized that true friendship is about being the unwavering support when the world around you seems uncertain.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No matter what storms come,” Finn said, “we always keep the light alive—for ourselves and for others.”  
        Mateo smiled, knowing their friendship had become a beacon, illuminating the value of loyalty, perseverance, and shared purpose.
