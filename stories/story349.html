        When Adrian was a boy, his mother told him: *“If you can carry your song to the mountain’s peak, the world will hear it.”*  
        He took those words literally.
      </p>

      <p>
        For years, he trained as a violinist, his music filling crowded streets but rarely reaching the audiences he longed for.  
        Critics dismissed him, saying he lacked brilliance. Friends urged him to give up. But Adrian believed in the mountain.
      </p>

      <p>
        On his thirtieth birthday, he climbed the tallest peak near his hometown, violin strapped to his back. The climb was brutal—wind lashed his face, his hands bled, and doubt whispered in his ear.  
        But he kept going, step after step, as if each footfall was part of a melody.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the summit, he raised his violin and played. The music soared into the sky, echoing across valleys. Hikers below stopped to listen. Birds wheeled overhead as if dancing. For a moment, the world was silent except for his song.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adrian realized his mother’s words weren’t about geography—they were about resilience. Carrying your song to the mountain meant refusing to give up until the world finally heard you.
