      <p>
        In the outskirts of Lahore, a teacher named Kamran walked into a classroom where silence was the loudest sound. Dozens of children sat, wide-eyed, but no one dared speak. They had never been in a school before; the chalkboard might as well have been a wall from another world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kamran realized that teaching here was not about curriculum—it was about awakening curiosity. On the first day, he didn’t touch the chalk. Instead, he told them a story: of a boy who learned to write his name in the dirt, and how that small act opened the doors of knowledge. Slowly, the children’s lips curved into hesitant smiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over months, the silence lifted. The classroom filled with recited poems, laughter, even debates about cricket. Parents peeked through the window, astonished. Education, which had been a privilege reserved for the wealthy in their village, had found its way into their children’s hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, one of those silent children became a teacher herself. She returned to the same school and faced her first classroom. She began the way Kamran had—by telling a story. Because sometimes, the first step in learning is not a lesson, but the breaking of silence.
