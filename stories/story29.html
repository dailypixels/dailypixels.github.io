      <p>
        The field was quiet, the kind of quiet that hums in your ears. I lay on the grass, staring at a sky 
        so clear it felt like I could reach up and pluck a star from it. This was the place we used to come every summer, 
        a secret escape just outside town, where laughter echoed through the warm nights. 
      </p>

      <p>
        But tonight, there was no laughter. Just me. Just the soft whisper of wind in the tall grass and the ache 
        of memories too heavy to carry. I thought of her smile—my sister’s smile—and how she’d point out constellations 
        I could never find, making up names when she didn’t know the real ones. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I closed my eyes, breathing in the smell of dry earth and wildflowers, and for the first time in months, 
        I felt the weight in my chest loosen. Grief had been a storm—loud, relentless—but here, under this sky, 
        it softened. I remembered her laugh, the way she’d tell me I was too serious, how she’d drag me here 
        just to watch the meteor showers.  
      </p>

      <p>
        A streak of light shot across the sky. Then another. I smiled through tears I didn’t realize were falling.  
        “There you are,” I whispered, like she could hear me. Maybe she could.
      </p>

      <p>
        I stayed until the stars began to fade, the horizon blushing with the first light of morning. 
        For the first time since she left, I didn’t feel alone. I felt her laughter in the breeze, 
        her warmth in the sunlight. I stood, brushing dew from my clothes, and made a promise: 
        to keep coming back here. To live enough for both of us.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I walked away, the field seemed alive again, crickets chirping their morning song, 
        and I realized grief hadn’t left me—it never would—but hope had returned, and that was enough.
