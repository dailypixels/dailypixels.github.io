      <p>
        Amelia and Daniel had been pen pals in their youth, separated by miles and circumstances, yet bound by heartfelt letters that spoke of dreams, fears, and quiet affection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, Amelia returned to her hometown to organize the local library archives. Among old letters, she discovered Daniel’s last note, expressing his hope that they would meet someday.
      </p>

      <p>
        Heart pounding, she searched for him, following subtle clues hidden in his letters. Eventually, she found him in the small café where they had once agreed to meet “someday.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Their eyes locked, years of longing dissolving instantly. Daniel smiled, holding out a letter with her name on it, “I never stopped writing… and I never stopped waiting.” Amelia laughed softly, tears in her eyes, replying, “And I never stopped reading.”  
        In that moment, letters and time were meaningless—they had finally found each other.
