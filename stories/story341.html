      <p>
        Every morning, the same old man sat on the park bench beneath the oak tree.  
        Children called him “Grandpa James,” though few knew his name.  
        Some avoided him, others greeted him, but he always smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        One afternoon, a young man sat beside him, shoulders slumped, eyes tired.  
        “Life feels heavy,” he confessed.  
        James chuckled softly. “That’s because you’re carrying it all at once.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He pointed to the oak tree. “See those leaves? They don’t fall all at once.  
        They let go, one by one. Do the same with your burdens.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The young man returned often, as did others. Over the years, the bench became a place where strangers found wisdom, encouragement, and laughter.  
        James’s simple presence taught them that sometimes, the greatest gift is listening without judgment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Long after James passed, the city placed a plaque on the bench: *“Here sat a man who carried nothing but kindness.”*
