        The old stone bridge at the edge of town was avoided by locals. It wasn’t ghosts they feared, but the strange echoes. A whisper under the arch could repeat itself five, sometimes six times, as if voices from another world answered back.
      </p>

        When journalist Clara investigated, she expected science — acoustics, angles, air currents. But the recordings revealed fragments of words never spoken by her. Names she didn’t know. Phrases like <em>“don’t forget the ledger”</em> and <em>“we never left.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Searching archives, she discovered that during the 1800s, the bridge had been a gathering place for revolutionaries. Many were captured; few returned. Their plans, their secrets, and their names were never documented — except perhaps in the stone itself.
      </p>

        Clara didn’t solve the mystery. But each time she played the tape, the voices grew clearer, as if history itself longed to be remembered. She stopped calling it an echo. She began calling it a testimony.
