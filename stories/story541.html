        The Harrington family never expected much from the inheritance. An abandoned manor in the countryside, left behind by a distant uncle no one remembered well. They thought it would be a fun project — restore it, sell it, maybe even keep it as a summer home.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first day passed quietly. But on the first night, Emma Harrington woke to a sound. Not footsteps. Not wind. <b>Whispers</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first, she thought it was her husband talking in his sleep. But when she leaned closer, the words were coming from the wall beside their bed — faint, urgent, like someone pressing their lips against the plaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Desperate, Emma tore away a strip of wallpaper. Behind it, not brick or beams — but <b>teeth. Tiny, human teeth</b> fused into the wood.
      </p>
<p>
  From that moment, the manor changed. Doors slammed shut on their own. Mirrors showed figures standing where no one was. At dinner, Emma swore she saw hands pushing outward from the walls, pressing against the paint as though trying to crawl through.
</p>
<p>
  Her husband refused to leave. “It’s just old plumbing. Rats. Drafts.” But the whispers grew louder, overlapping into a chorus of voices screaming through the house.
</p>
<p>
  On the seventh night, the children’s rooms were empty. Only their small handprints remained on the inside of the walls, pressed deep into the plaster.
</p>
<p>
  Emma fled barefoot into the night, never once looking back.
</p>
<p>
  When police searched the manor weeks later, they found it empty. No sign of the family. No furniture. No belongings. Only one phrase scratched into the wood of the dining table:
</p>

<h2>“We are part of the house now.”</h2>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  Sometimes the past doesn’t stay buried — it consumes the present. The story warns of ignoring the warnings etched into history, for some homes aren’t built to shelter, but to feed.
