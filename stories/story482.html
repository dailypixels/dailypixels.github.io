        On the corner of the bazaar sat Hameed, the cobbler, bent over leather and thread. His hands were cracked, but his stitches were firm—shoes walked longer because of him.  
      </p>
      <p>
        His son, Arif, often complained. “Why not sell the bench and find another job?”  
      </p>
      <p>
        Hameed only smiled. “This bench raised you, fed us, kept you in school. Don’t disrespect it.”  
      </p>
      <p>
        Years later, when Hameed was gone, Arif kept the bench. He didn’t stitch shoes—he polished it, kept it safe, and told his children, “Your grandfather built a life from this wood.”  
      </p>
      <p>
        The bench, like the man, became a quiet monument to dignity.
