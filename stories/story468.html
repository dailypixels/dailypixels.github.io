      <p>
        In a small mountain town, a lantern maker named Idris was known for crafting lanterns that glowed brighter than any flame. People whispered they contained fragments of stars, though he only smiled and said: *“Light comes from those who carry it.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        Every year, on the Festival of Renewal, families lit Idris’s lanterns and placed them along the river, watching them drift like constellations across the water. Children believed each lantern carried a wish to the heavens.
      </p>

      <p>
        One harsh winter, Idris fell ill. His workshop closed, and villagers feared the festival would darken. But when they gathered by the river, Idris appeared, pale yet smiling, holding a single great lantern. He placed it on the water and whispered: *“This one carries not one wish, but all of ours together.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        The lantern glided downstream, its light swelling until the entire river shimmered. People gasped as their reflections appeared clearer than ever, as if the lantern returned their own hidden strength to them. Hope spread like fire on frost.
      </p>

      <p>
        Idris passed quietly a week later, but the festival continued every year. Villagers no longer placed only their own lanterns; they lit one great lantern together, honoring his gift. They understood now: the truest light was not borrowed from stars but created when people shared hope as one.
