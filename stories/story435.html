        At dusk, when the streetlamps flickered on, the bookshop glowed like a lantern in the alley. Its shelves leaned with age, and the bell above the door rang like a whisper. Few customers wandered in at that hour, but those who did often found more than books.

        Anwar discovered a volume with no title, its pages filled with handwritten notes from a stranger. The words read less like commentary and more like a diary, filled with longing for someone unnamed. Each entry ended with the same phrase: “I’ll wait for you here.”
