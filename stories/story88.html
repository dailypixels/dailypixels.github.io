    <main class="story-content">
      <p>
        Emma and Zoe had always faced life side by side.  
        From childhood adventures to teenage heartbreaks,  
        they had been each other’s constant.  
        But adulthood brought challenges that tested even the strongest bonds.
      </p>

      <p>
        One stormy night, Emma received a call: Zoe was struggling,  
        overwhelmed by work and family pressures.  
        Without hesitation, Emma drove through the rain to her friend’s side,  
        knowing that presence was sometimes more powerful than words.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, they climbed to the hill overlooking their town,  
        carrying lanterns they had decorated together as children.  
        As the rain eased, they lit the lanterns and watched them rise into the night sky.  
        Each glowing light represented hope, resilience, and the enduring power of friendship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Watching the lanterns float, Zoe whispered, “Even in the darkest times,  
        you’ve always been my light.”  
        Emma smiled, “And you’ve always been mine.”  
        In that moment, they understood that friendship is a sanctuary,  
        a bond that carries strength beyond the trials of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lanterns disappeared into the horizon,  
        leaving behind a glow that reminded them both:  
        no matter how dark the night, hope can rise when friends hold each other close.
