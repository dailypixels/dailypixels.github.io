        Noor struggled with the sudden loss of her mentor. Each day felt fragmented, like pieces of a mirror shattered across the floor. Through journaling, conversations with friends, and self-reflection, she began piecing together her emotions and purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        She learned that healing is not linear. Some days brought clarity, others grief, yet each step forward strengthened her resilience. Noor realized that embracing vulnerability allowed her to reconnect with herself and rebuild relationships she had neglected.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end, Noor’s reflection in the mirror no longer seemed fractured. She had learned to carry grief, hope, and wisdom together, understanding that life’s beauty often emerges through struggle and persistence.
