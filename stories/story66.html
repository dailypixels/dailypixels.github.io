      <p>
        When Claire moved back into her grandmother’s house,  
        she expected dust, cobwebs, and memories.  
        What she didn’t expect was a small wooden chest tucked away  
        in the attic rafters, its lock broken with age.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, tied with a faded blue ribbon,  
        were letters written decades ago.  
        Each was signed with the same name: **Michael**.  
        Each ended with the words: *“I’ll wait for you.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        As she read, Claire realized these weren’t her grandmother’s.  
        They were her mother’s—written to a man she had never spoken about.  
        The letters told of moonlit walks by the river,  
        stolen kisses at the train station,  
        and promises made under starlight.  
      </p>

      <p>
        But the last letter was different.  
        It was unfinished, the ink smudged.  
        *“If you don’t come tonight, I’ll know it’s over.  
        But I’ll love you still, always.”*  
        The date was the night before her mother had married her father.
      </p>

      <p>
        Claire’s heart ached.  
        She couldn’t reconcile the loving, faithful woman she knew  
        with the passion spilling from those pages.  
        On impulse, she searched the town archives,  
        wondering what had become of Michael.
      </p>

      <p>
        She found him—not in records of death, but in a quiet nursing home.  
        Now an old man, eyes clouded but still kind,  
        he smiled when she introduced herself.  
        “You look just like her,” he whispered.  
        A single tear rolled down his cheek.
      </p>

      <p>
        That evening, Claire returned to the attic.  
        She placed the unfinished letter back in the chest,  
        but this time, she added her own note.  
        *“Michael still remembers. She loved you, too.  
        Maybe not the way you dreamed, but enough to keep you alive in memory.”*  
      </p>

      <p>
        Closing the lid, she felt a peace settle over her.  
        Love, she realized, was not always about happy endings—  
        but about the stories that survive long after we’re gone.
