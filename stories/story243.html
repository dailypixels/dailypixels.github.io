    <main class="story-content">
      <p>They called it the City of a Thousand Lanterns — a place where every life was tied to a single flame. Each lantern hung high in the celestial towers, burning as long as its owner breathed. When the light dimmed, so too did the life below.</p>

<p>Thalen was one of the Lantern Keepers — quiet souls who climbed the glass towers each night to tend the flames. He was not a mage, not a warrior, just a caretaker of light. But in his hands, the lanterns always seemed to burn a little brighter.</p>

<p>One evening, as twilight bled into the clouds, Thalen found a lantern flickering violently — its glass cracked, its flame sputtering like it was fighting to stay alive. The name engraved beneath it chilled him: <em>Eira Valen</em> — the Empress of the city.</p>

<p>He froze. The Empress’s light should have been eternal, fed by the strongest enchantments known. If her flame faltered, it meant something was terribly wrong in the world below.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thalen descended into the royal district, his lantern pole clutched tight. The city shimmered with floating lights and whispering wind spirits, but a heavy silence blanketed the palace. Guards lay asleep at their posts, as if under a spell. Inside the throne room, the Empress knelt alone, her golden crown dim.</p>

<p>“You should not be here,” she said softly when she saw him.</p>

<p>“Your lantern is dying,” Thalen replied. “If it goes out, so will you.”</p>

<p>She smiled faintly. “I know. The flame burns with the heart of its keeper. Mine falters because I’ve lost the will to rule. I cannot save a people who no longer believe in light.”</p>

<p>Thalen’s gaze fell to the great mosaic beneath them — once vibrant, now darkened with soot. “Then let me carry it for you,” he said. “Your light.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “A Keeper cannot bear the flame of a sovereign. It would destroy you.”</p>

<p>But Thalen stepped forward anyway. “Then let it burn. Better one light lost than a thousand extinguished.”</p>

<hr>

<p>He reached into the lantern’s core and took hold of the fading flame. It roared instantly, flooding the chamber with blinding gold. His hands blistered, his breath caught fire — yet he did not let go.</p>

<p>The Empress’s lantern flared anew above the city. The sleeping guards awoke, the stars shone brighter, and the floating lights returned to their full brilliance. In the heart of that radiance, Thalen vanished — his mortal form consumed by the light he refused to surrender.</p>

<hr>

<p>When dawn came, a new lantern appeared in the highest tower — one with no name engraved upon it. Its flame never dimmed. The Keepers called it <em>The Eternal Beacon</em>. And whenever a lantern faltered, that nameless light would shimmer and steady it, as if some unseen hand still tended the flames.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Lantern Keeper</em> is a tale of sacrifice, duty, and unseen heroism. It reminds us that even the quietest souls can hold the greatest light — and that sometimes, saving the world begins not with a crown, but with a single act of selfless faith. 🕯️✨</p>
