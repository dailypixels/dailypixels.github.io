        They called it the Whispering Bridge, an old iron structure on the edge of the city. Teenagers dared one another to cross it at midnight, but few ever did. A legend said if you stopped in the middle, you’d hear voices—fragments of unfinished stories.
      </p>

        Zara was skeptical, until one rainy night curiosity dragged her there. The bridge groaned beneath her feet. She stood still, heart pounding. At first there was only the wind. Then—soft voices, like echoes through water. 
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t leave… find me…” they whispered. She nearly ran, but something in the tone—pleading, human—kept her frozen. She realized they weren’t ghosts, but memories, embedded into the iron by those who once stood where she now stood. Lost confessions. Unspoken truths. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Zara returned often, recording the whispers, piecing together fragments into stories. The bridge wasn’t cursed—it was a library of the unsaid. And she, unwillingly, had become its archivist.
