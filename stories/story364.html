        On a quiet street corner, tucked between cafes, there was a small bookshop. Its windows were foggy, pages yellowed, and the bell above the door rang with a gentle chime. Everyone in the neighborhood had a story tied to it: first dates, secret hideaways, or rainy afternoons spent reading.

        Clara, the owner, had inherited it from her grandfather. Each book held a memory, and she treated them like old friends. Children pressed their noses to the glass, dreaming of worlds inside. Adults browsed slowly, searching for comfort between covers.
