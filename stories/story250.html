     <p>Commander Alina Voss floated in the observation deck of the *Solstice Voyager*, staring at the dim crescent of a planet long forgotten. The blue faded centuries ago. The oceans boiled, the atmosphere scattered into the void. That planet — once called Earth — was now a cold scar drifting in the black.</p>

<p>It had been two hundred years since the last known transmission. Humanity had scattered among the stars, building colonies, stations, artificial worlds. But none ever called them home. Alina had grown up among metal corridors and glass domes, never touching soil, never feeling wind. Earth was a myth to her — a nursery tale for star-born children.</p>

<p>And then, on the fourteenth day of her deep-space patrol, the ship’s comms came alive.</p>

<p><em>—This is Earth Mission Control... anyone receiving? Please respond.</em></p>

<p>Her heart froze. The signal was faint, fractured by centuries of distortion. She checked her instruments twice. No ship in the fleet could have produced that frequency — it was ancient, obsolete, from the early twenty-first century.</p>

<p>“This can’t be real,” she whispered. “Earth went silent in 2328.”</p>

<p>The message repeated, weaker this time. Then static. Then silence.</p>

<hr>

<p>Alina rerouted all power to long-range communication. “This is Commander Voss of the *Solstice Voyager*. Identify yourself.”</p>

<p>No response.</p>

<p>She replayed the signal again, analyzing waveforms, trying to trace origin coordinates. It pointed to the dead planet itself — the ruins of Houston Base, buried beneath a kilometer of ash and glass. Yet, within that ruin, something still pulsed — faint electromagnetic activity, impossible after all these years.</p>

<p>Against protocol, she adjusted trajectory and descended.</p>

<hr>

<p>The planet’s surface glowed faintly red beneath her ship’s thrusters. Towers jutted out of the dust like broken bones. She landed near what had once been Mission Control. Her suit’s radiation alarms screamed, but she pressed on through the ruins, guided by the intermittent signal.</p>

<p>Inside, she found a single console still flickering with power — a machine built when humanity still believed in tomorrow. Its screen displayed a looping message, barely legible:</p>

<p><em>“If anyone ever finds this… we tried to warn them. We thought we had time. We didn’t.”</em></p>

<p>Then the screen changed. A face appeared — grainy, human, smiling faintly through static. “To whoever you are,” the voice said, “remember us. Remember Earth.”</p>

<p>Alina knelt. Her gloved fingers brushed against a cracked plaque embedded in the dust: <strong>Mission Control, NASA — Home of the First Dreamers.</strong></p>

<p>She closed her eyes. For the first time in her life, she wept. Not for what was lost — but for what it had meant to exist at all.</p>

<hr>

<p>When she returned to orbit, she broadcasted the recording across every known channel, every colony and station. For days, the message echoed through the void — a single fragile voice carrying across the stars:</p>

<p><em>“Remember Earth.”</em></p>

<p>And for the first time in centuries, humanity listened.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Signal of Earth</em> is a story of memory and legacy — a reminder that even when civilizations vanish, the essence of who we were can echo beyond time. Technology may carry us far, but it’s our shared past that anchors us to meaning. The true measure of progress isn’t how far we go, but how deeply we remember. 🌌</p>
