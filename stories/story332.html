      <p>
        In 2149, memories had become currency. People traded away their happiest moments for wealth, or sold nightmares for peace of mind. Markets thrived with glowing capsules, each holding fragments of lives lived.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mara, a street vendor, specialized in “borrowed joy”—the laughter of weddings, the thrill of first love. But one day, a stranger offered her a capsule unlike any other. When she opened it, she saw her own childhood, stolen years ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rage burned. She traced the capsule back to a cartel that trafficked stolen pasts. With nothing but grit, Mara fought to reclaim her memories—and along the way, she uncovered an even greater truth: the most powerful currency was not what we sell, but what we refuse to give away.
      </p>

      <p>
        She kept the capsule close, vowing never again to trade away the pieces that made her whole.
