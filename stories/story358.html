        Mara walked through the park, her steps slow, lost in thought. The bench under the old oak tree had been empty for years, forgotten by the regular visitors. Yet for her, it was sacred—a place where her father had taught her to whistle, where summers had stretched like golden ribbons.

        She sat down, fingers brushing the weathered wood. Memories surfaced: laughter echoing through the air, the scent of fallen leaves, the quiet conversations that required no words. She realized life was full of such forgotten corners, small spaces where meaning lingered silently.
      </p>
