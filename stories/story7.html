    <main class="story-content">
     <p> The mirror arrived on a rainy afternoon. **Elena Voss**, thirty-four, a restorer of rare antiques, signed for the delivery and wiped her hands on her apron. The frame was carved mahogany, etched with strange looping patterns like vines trying to write words. At the top, almost hidden beneath the grime, was a date: *1893*. </p> <p> She placed it against the wall of her studio and stood back. The glass was dark ‚Äî not from dirt, but from depth. When she leaned closer, her reflection seemed slightly delayed, as if the mirror took its time to remember who she was. </p> <p> That night, as thunder cracked outside, Elena woke to the sound of whispers ‚Äî low, rhythmic, as if someone was reciting names. She turned on the lamp. The mirror was glowing faintly, its surface rippling like disturbed water. For a heartbeat, she saw someone standing behind her ‚Äî a pale woman in a Victorian dress, face blurred, hand raised in silence. </p> <p> Elena spun around. The studio was empty. When she turned back, the mirror showed only herself ‚Äî but her reflection was smiling. And she wasn‚Äôt. </p> <p> The next morning she told herself it was fatigue. She had been restoring the old **Black Hollow collection**, furniture from a mansion that burned down after a series of disappearances in 1901. The mirror was said to be the only object recovered intact. The legend went that the last owner, **Margaret Hollow**, spent her final years staring into it, whispering to her own reflection. </p> <p> Elena worked through the day, polishing the frame, tracing every carved detail. The patterns formed words she couldn‚Äôt quite read ‚Äî Latin, perhaps: *Speculum meminit* ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe mirror remembers.‚Äù </p> <p> By evening, her studio lights began flickering again. She saw, for an instant, dozens of faces behind her in the mirror ‚Äî men, women, children ‚Äî all staring out with hollow eyes. Then the light steadied, and they were gone. But one fingerprint remained on the glass, from the inside. </p> <p> That night, Elena recorded herself sleeping. At 3:12 AM, the camera caught her rising slowly, eyes open, walking toward the mirror. She placed her hand on the glass ‚Äî and her reflection reached back. Then the screen went black. </p> <p> She woke on the floor with cuts on her palm and a strange taste of smoke in the air. The camera was shattered. On the wall, written in condensation, were the words: > *‚ÄúYou fixed the frame. Now fix the rest of us.‚Äù* </p> <p> Terrified, she called her friend **Marcus**, a curator at the city museum. He arrived by dusk, skeptical but concerned. When he saw the mirror, his face drained of color. ‚ÄúElena‚Ä¶ this was catalogued as destroyed. How did you get it?‚Äù She blinked. ‚ÄúIt came from the Black Hollow estate.‚Äù Marcus shook his head. ‚ÄúThat house never had an estate sale.‚Äù </p> <p> Before she could answer, the lights went out. A cold wind swept through the studio though the windows were shut. The mirror began to hum ‚Äî a low, human note. In the dim light of Marcus‚Äôs phone, their reflections began to move independently. Her reflection leaned forward, whispering something neither could hear. Then it pressed its hand to the glass ‚Äî and cracks spread outward like veins of ice. </p> <p> Marcus screamed as the reflection pulled him in. Elena lunged, grabbing his arm ‚Äî but the glass swallowed him whole. She stumbled back, staring at the mirror. Inside, she saw Marcus pounding silently from the other side, his mouth open in an endless scream. Behind him stood the woman in the Victorian dress, placing a finger to her lips. </p> <p> Elena smashed the mirror with a hammer. The glass shattered ‚Äî but instead of falling, the shards hung in the air, each one showing a different scene: a ballroom filled with fire, a child‚Äôs face crying for help, Margaret Hollow turning toward her with burning eyes. Then everything went dark. </p> <p> When dawn came, neighbors found the studio empty. The floor was covered in dust ‚Äî and standing against the wall was a spotless mirror, perfectly intact. Inside it, faintly, was the reflection of a woman still hammering against the glass. </p> <p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Mirror at Black Hollow* is a story about obsession, memory, and how reflections can trap what reality refuses to keep. It reminds us that every object carries a shadow of the people who touched it ‚Äî and that some restorations are better left unfinished. For what is a mirror, after all, if not a doorway for those who still wish to be seen? ü™û </p>
