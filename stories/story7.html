      <p>
        Every spring, the town gathered by the river to send lanterns into the sky. Children clutched their glowing paper lights while elders whispered blessings into the evening breeze. But this year, one lantern was missing—Grandmother Rosa’s lantern, a tradition passed through generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Someone stole it,” muttered my younger brother, Tomas, clutching his own lantern tightly. Whispers spread quickly through the crowd. A thief, on the night of the Lantern Festival? It seemed impossible, yet the empty space where Rosa’s lantern had rested felt like a wound.
      </p>

      <p>
        My friends and I set out to find it, weaving through narrow alleyways where shadows flickered like secrets. The scent of roasted corn and cinnamon hung in the air, masking the tension that had crept into the celebration.
      </p>

      <p>
        We found him by the docks—a boy no older than me, barefoot and trembling, clutching the delicate lantern to his chest. His eyes darted between us, wide with fear. He wasn’t a hardened thief, just a boy with no family, who had taken the lantern hoping for a wish of his own.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of anger, Rosa offered him her scarf and a soft smile. “Light it with us,” she said. That night, as the lanterns rose like stars, the boy stood beside us, his face glowing in the warm light. He didn’t speak, but he didn’t need to. The promise was in his eyes—that he’d never forget this kindness, this family he’d found, even if only for a night.
