      <p>
        Elias ran his fingers over the intricate gears of an ancient clock. Every tick echoed in the silence of his shop, a heartbeat of secrets long kept. The townspeople whispered of his uncanny skill, but no one knew the truth: each clock held a memory, a fragment of someone’s forgotten past.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One stormy night, a stranger arrived, asking for a timepiece to remember something he couldn’t recall. Elias nodded, understanding immediately. Carefully, he adjusted gears that only he could align, and as the hands moved, the man’s eyes widened—visions of lost moments, childhood laughter, and unspoken goodbyes appeared.  
      </p>
      <p>
        When the stranger left, a sense of peace lingered in the shop. Elias smiled faintly. The clocks would continue to tick, and with each tick, secrets and memories would whisper quietly, awaiting those patient enough to listen.
