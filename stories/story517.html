      <p>
        In a forgotten wing of Karachi’s public library, there was a small room locked with a rusted key. Few visitors knew it existed, and even fewer knew the man who had filled it—an unassuming archivist named Rafiq. For forty years, Rafiq had been collecting something most people ignored: voices.
      </p>

      <p>
        His project began in the 1980s with a borrowed tape recorder. At first, he recorded shopkeepers describing their day, children reciting poems, old women singing lullabies. Later, he interviewed migrants who had lost their homes, workers whose hands bore the story of the city’s rise, and widows whose husbands had never returned from war. Each tape was carefully labeled with a name, a date, and a single line about the person’s story.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why voices?” someone once asked him. Rafiq had smiled gently: “Photographs fade, letters get burned, but voices—voices hold the breath of a soul. They are memory alive.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time he retired, Rafiq’s collection filled thousands of tapes, stacked neatly from floor to ceiling. But no one knew. Not the library board, not the press, not even most of his colleagues. He didn’t seek recognition; he sought preservation. For him, each recording was a time capsule of humanity.
      </p>

      <p>
        One winter, the library announced renovations. The wing that housed his tapes was marked for demolition. Alarmed, a young volunteer stumbled upon the collection and was stunned. She brought in historians, journalists, even musicians. When the first recordings were played publicly—a fisherman describing the sea at dawn, a mother humming to her child—the audience wept. The rawness, the authenticity, the humanity in those voices was undeniable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Soon, “The Voice Archive” became a national treasure. The tapes were digitized, played on radio, used in documentaries, and even studied in schools. People discovered their grandparents, neighbors, and forgotten community members immortalized in sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Rafiq never lived to see the fame. He passed quietly in his sleep weeks before the archive was unveiled. At his memorial, one of his tapes was played—his own voice, recorded decades ago, saying: <em>“If you are listening, it means my dream survived. It means voices, no matter how small, are never lost.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        In that moment, everyone understood. Rafiq had not been collecting tapes. He had been collecting people—their laughter, their grief, their truths. He left behind not just an archive, but a reminder: we are remembered not by monuments, but by the echoes we leave in others.
