      <p>
        Layla wrote a letter addressed to her future self. She listed dreams, small victories, and the courage she hoped to carry.  
      </p>
      <p>
        She sealed it and placed it in the mailbox, smiling at the thought that tomorrow, she might be braver than today, stronger than yesterday.  
      </p>
      <p>
        That simple act reminded her that hope isn’t abstract—it lives in intentions, in small steps, and the belief that every day holds potential for joy and growth.
