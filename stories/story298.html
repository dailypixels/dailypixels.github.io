        Emma folded the last letter carefully, sealing it with a small wax stamp before placing it on the windowsill for the morning post. The sea wind brushed her hair as the waves crashed below the cliffs — the same sound that had carried Thomas’s ship away three years ago.

        He was a cartographer, tracing the edges of unknown lands. She was a writer, filling pages with stories he had yet to live. When he left, he promised her, “Every shore I find, I’ll write your name in the sand.” It had been a romantic gesture then. Now, it was her lifeline.

        His letters came from distant harbors — Lisbon, Alexandria, Calcutta — each one written in his bold, slanted hand. *“Emma, the stars over this coast remind me of the freckles across your cheeks.”* She would smile and read those lines aloud, imagining his voice in the quiet of her cottage.
      </p>

        Seasons passed. Her ink-stained fingers became accustomed to answering him — to telling him of the roses that bloomed by their gate, of the cat that still waited by the dock every evening. She never told him about the loneliness that visited her at night, or how the world felt too still without his laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then one winter, the letters stopped. A storm had struck the Indian coast, and news spread that a ship was lost — his ship. Emma refused to believe it. For months, she walked the cliffs every dawn, scanning the horizon, whispering prayers into the wind.
      </p>

        A year passed before a final envelope arrived, water-stained and frayed. Inside, his handwriting trembled, the ink faded but legible. *“If this reaches you, it means I’ve found my way home, even if not by sea. I’ve drawn every coastline I could, but the only map that mattered was the one leading back to you.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        Beneath the letter, folded small, was a sketch — of their cottage, the cliffs, and the two of them beneath a lone tree. Her tears blurred the ink, but she smiled through them. Love, she realized, was not measured by distance or time but by the words we leave behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Emma placed the letter inside a small wooden box, where dozens of others rested. Every evening, she would light a candle and read one aloud, her voice joining the sound of the waves. In those moments, the sea no longer felt like a divide, but a promise — that love endures, carried by the wind, across every horizon.
