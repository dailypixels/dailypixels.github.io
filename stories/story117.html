      <p>When the rains stopped, the world learned how loud silence could be.</p>

<p>For forty years, <em>Hale Rowan</em> had tended the royal gardens of <strong>Calderis</strong> — once the most beautiful city on earth. Its orchards, fountains, and vines had fed a kingdom and its dreams. But now the soil was dust, the trees were gray skeletons, and the rivers were nothing but scars carved into the ground.</p>

<p>Hale was the last gardener left. The others had left long ago when the sun began to burn too fiercely. Yet every dawn, he still came to the palace courtyard with his rusty trowel, his hands trembling from age but steady from purpose.</p>

<p>One morning, while clearing the cracked earth around a dead rosebush, he uncovered something hard and round — a seed, black as night and smooth as stone. He couldn’t believe it. A seed had survived the decades of drought. But written faintly along its shell was something else — a mark shaped like a tear.</p>

<p>He carried it to the Queen, who was too frail to stand. “It’s just a relic,” she murmured. “Even if it grows, there’s no water left to feed it.”</p>

<p>But Hale smiled gently. “Then I’ll find water where none remains.”</p>

<p>He set out beyond the city walls, carrying the seed in a small pouch over his heart. The air shimmered with heat, the ground split beneath his boots. For days, he walked across the wastelands — past the skeletons of windmills, rusted cars buried in sand, and valleys filled with the bones of forests.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, he collapsed beneath a dry cliff. His lips were cracked, his vision blurred. He thought of turning back — but when he opened the pouch and saw the seed glowing faintly in the dying light, he whispered, “You waited this long. I can wait one more day.”</p>

<p>He dug a small hole with his hands and placed the seed inside. He poured the last drops of water from his flask over it, then covered it gently. “Grow,” he said softly, “even if no one is here to see it.”</p>

<p>Then he rested against the cliff, the sound of wind the only witness to his prayer.</p>

<p>When dawn came, the desert shimmered differently. A thin, impossible green stem had broken through the ground where he’d planted the seed. By noon, it had grown tall enough to cast a shadow — the first shadow made by something living in decades.</p>

<p>Travelers later found the spot months later — a small oasis blooming from nothing. The seed had taken root, and its roots spread beneath the cracked earth, finding forgotten wells and feeding new life. They called it <strong>The Spring of Rowan</strong>.</p>

<p>No one ever found Hale’s body, only his hat and his trowel near the tree’s base. But every year, when the first leaves bloom, the people say the wind carries his voice through the branches — whispering, “Grow, even when the world forgets how.”</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Seed of Spring</em> is a reminder that even in the driest seasons of life, hope can take root. True faith isn’t about knowing that life will return — it’s about planting the seed anyway. Every act of care, no matter how small, becomes a bridge between despair and renewal. 🌱☀️💧</p>
