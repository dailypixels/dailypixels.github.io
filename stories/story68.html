      <p>
        Every small town has its legends,  
        and in Willow Creek, it was the house at the end of Ashwood Lane.  
        Children whispered about strange lights in the windows,  
        about voices that drifted across the fields at night.  
        No one lived there, not for decades—  
        or so they claimed.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Detective Morgan never believed in ghost stories.  
        She dealt in facts, evidence, things that could be explained.  
        But when three teenagers vanished within a month—  
        each last seen near Ashwood Lane—  
        she found herself standing before the decaying front porch,  
        flashlight trembling slightly in her hand.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, the air was heavy with mildew and rot.  
        The wallpaper peeled like old scabs,  
        and the floorboards groaned under her boots.  
        She swept her light across the living room—  
        broken furniture, a smashed clock,  
        and something scratched into the wall:  
        *“STILL HERE.”*  
      </p>

      <p>
        Her radio crackled with static.  
        “Morgan, do you copy?” the dispatcher’s voice came through,  
        warped and distant.  
        She raised it to her lips but froze—  
        from upstairs came the creak of a footstep.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Gun drawn, she climbed the staircase.  
        Every step echoed in the suffocating silence.  
        At the top, she found a long hallway lined with doors.  
        One stood slightly ajar.  
        A faint light flickered inside.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Pushing it open, she found a room filled with old toys,  
        their glass eyes reflecting her beam.  
        In the center of the floor sat a tape recorder.  
        She pressed play.  
        A child’s voice whispered:  
        *“We’re still here. And now… so are you.”*  
      </p>

      <p>
        The door slammed behind her.  
        Her flashlight died.  
        And in the darkness, dozens of tiny hands  
        brushed against her arms.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning, the house stood silent once more.  
        But if you looked closely at the peeling wallpaper,  
        you could see new words scratched beneath the old ones:  
        *“MORGAN IS HERE TOO.”*
