      <p>
        The abandoned mansion at the edge of the city had always been  
        a source of rumors, but Detective Mason Reed had a reputation  
        for chasing truth where others feared to tread.  
        The call came late at night: a body discovered inside the so-called Silent Room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, the room was empty except for a single chair in the center,  
        and the faint smell of something metallic.  
        The victim lay collapsed on the floor, eyes wide, hands clenched,  
        as if they had seen something beyond comprehension.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mason noticed strange markings along the walls—symbols that seemed familiar  
        yet distorted. He remembered a similar case from years ago  
        that was never solved: a series of disappearances linked by cryptic notes.  
        The pieces fit together too well to be coincidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours of investigation turned into days. Every lead pointed back to the mansion,  
        and the deeper Mason dug, the more he realized someone was orchestrating a game,  
        taunting him, leaving hints only he could decipher.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, Mason returned alone to the Silent Room, following a trail of subtle clues.  
        Shadows flickered under the dim light. A whisper echoed:  
        <em>"You’re closer than you think."</em>  
        Then he noticed the old grandfather clock ticking backwards,  
        revealing a hidden compartment behind its face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, Mason found photographs of himself, spanning years—moments he never shared,  
        memories he hadn’t realized were being observed.  
        And there, standing in the corner, was someone he trusted more than anyone:  
        his partner, Agent Collins.  
        Collins had orchestrated the disappearances to test Mason,  
        claiming the final revelation was “the only way to prepare him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Mason’s shock turned to rage and disbelief, but Collins vanished before confrontation,  
        leaving the Silent Room empty and cold.  
        The case file Mason carried afterward bore a chilling note:  
        <em>"Some secrets are meant to follow you forever."</em>
      </p>

      <p class="end-note">
        Mason realized the city itself could never be fully safe,  
        and the line between ally and enemy could vanish in a single step.  
        The Silent Room had spoken—and its echo would never fade.
