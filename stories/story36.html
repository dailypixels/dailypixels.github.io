        It started as a simple grocery run. Bread, eggs, milk. That was it.  
        But as soon as I stepped into the supermarket, I knew something was off.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, there was the elderly man riding a mobility scooter at NASCAR speeds down the cereal aisle, 
        scattering boxes of Cheerios like confetti.  
        Then came the announcement over the loudspeaker: *“Attention shoppers: please refrain from sword-fighting 
        with baguettes.”*  
        I hadn’t even reached the dairy section yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Things escalated when I found myself in the middle of a standoff between two toddlers over the last box of 
        dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets. Their parents stood by, locked in a passive-aggressive stare-down of epic 
        proportions.  
        I did what any sane adult would do: grabbed the nuggets and sprinted.
      </p>

      <p>
        By aisle seven, chaos was in full swing. A kid in a Batman cape zoomed past me pushing a cart full of soda, 
        a woman was passionately arguing with a self-checkout machine, and someone was playing dramatic opera music 
        over a Bluetooth speaker.  
        I just wanted milk. Was that too much to ask?
      </p>

      <p>
        When I finally reached the checkout line, a man in front of me was trying to price-match avocados to 
        “what they cost in 1997,” according to him.  
        Behind me, a parrot in someone’s shopping cart loudly yelled, “Hurry up!” every five seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        I left the store 47 minutes later with half my list, a dented can of beans I don’t remember picking up, 
        and a vow never to shop at 5 PM on a Sunday again.  
        As I got to my car, I heard the loudspeaker one more time:  
        *“Attention shoppers: we are now officially out of baguettes.”*
