      <p>
        In an old quarter of the city, where shutters rotted and cobblestones cracked, strangers began noticing fresh paint: doors that had not opened in decades gleamed with vibrant colors — emerald, indigo, crimson. No one knew who painted them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mystery deepened when each door bore a small symbol: a feather, a lantern, a child’s shoe. People whispered they matched memories, though few admitted which belonged to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amina, a teacher, discovered a door painted with a book and inkpot. She remembered sneaking into that house as a girl to read when her own family discouraged her. Tears filled her eyes as she touched the wood. Others had similar stories — a merchant recognized the lantern where he once confessed his love, a widow the feather marking her husband’s favorite bird.
      </p>

      <p>
        The painter remained unseen. But the doors kept appearing, each unlocking not wood but memory. They became sacred spaces, not for entering, but for remembering what once mattered and could matter still.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, a child asked, *“Why are these doors painted if they never open?”* Amina replied: *“Because some doors don’t lead outside, but inside. They remind us where we’ve been, so we know where to go.”*
