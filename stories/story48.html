      <p>
        The rain hadn’t stopped all night. It slicked the cobblestones,  
        turned every flickering streetlight into a hazy halo,  
        and carried whispers through the alleyway like secrets being passed hand-to-hand.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I pulled my coat tighter and kept moving.  
        The message had been clear: *“Come alone. Midnight.”*  
        But the further I walked, the more I was certain someone was already here.  
      </p>

      <p>
        A shadow shifted at the end of the alley.  
        I froze.  
        The figure wasn’t moving, but I could feel its eyes on me—sharp, calculating.  
        The sound of dripping water filled the silence,  
        each drop a countdown.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re late,” a voice rasped from the dark.  
        My heart slammed against my ribs.  
        The figure stepped forward, light catching on a gloved hand,  
        a glint of metal in their pocket.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “I got what you wanted,” I said, voice barely steady.  
        My hand brushed against the envelope inside my jacket,  
        its contents heavier than gold,  
        heavier than my conscience.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The stranger chuckled—a sound as sharp as broken glass.  
        “Then why,” they said, “did you bring company?”  
      </p>

      <p>
        My blood ran cold.  
        Behind me, footsteps echoed, slow and deliberate.  
        The alley narrowed like a trap,  
        and for the first time tonight,  
        I realized I might not walk out.  
      </p>
