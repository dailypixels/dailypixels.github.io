    <main class="story-content">
      <p> For three months, <em>Eva</em> hadn’t stepped outside. The walls of her small apartment had become both her comfort and her cage. Since the accident, she’d lived in a haze — soundless mornings, quiet afternoons, and long nights that stretched like unanswered questions. </p> <p> Her window overlooked an ordinary street — nothing special. A row of old buildings, a tree with uneven branches, and a bakery whose scent drifted up with the wind. But that window was all she had left of the world. She would sit there every morning, watching people go by — mothers with strollers, a postman humming to himself, schoolchildren racing each other down the lane. And though her body felt heavy, something about those fleeting moments stirred a faint heartbeat inside her. </p> <p> Then, one morning, she noticed a small card taped to the bakery window across the street. It read: <em>“Good morning, whoever you are — you’re stronger than yesterday.”</em> </p> <p> She smiled faintly. Maybe it was a message for someone else. But the next day, another note appeared: <em>“You matter more than you think.”</em> </p> <p> Curiosity pulled at her. Each day, a new message awaited — handwritten, hopeful, like someone knew exactly what she needed to hear. “Breathe.” “You’re not forgotten.” “Sunshine always finds a way.” </p> <p> Eva began to wait for them. She’d wake early, brush her hair, sit by the window with tea, and smile — something she hadn’t done in months. Her plants began to thrive again. She watered them daily, letting sunlight fill the room. And one morning, when the bakery opened, she saw him — the baker. A young man with kind eyes, holding a fresh loaf in one hand and a marker in the other. He looked up, caught her gaze, and waved. She froze — then, slowly, lifted her hand in return. </p> <p> The next note read: <em>“Hello, neighbor. It’s good to see you smile.”</em> </p> <p> Something shifted inside her that day. She opened her window, letting the spring air rush in — cool, alive, real. The smell of bread, the laughter below, the hum of morning — it all felt new. Like the world had been waiting patiently for her to come back. </p> <p> Weeks later, she walked outside for the first time. The street was smaller than she remembered, the air lighter. The baker waved her over, smiling. “I was wondering when you’d come out,” he said, offering her a loaf. “I started writing those notes after I noticed someone always watching the sunrise.” </p> <p> Tears welled in her eyes. She took the bread, warm and soft in her hands, and whispered, “Thank you… for the sunlight.” He smiled gently. “You found it yourself. I just helped open the window.” </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Window of Sunlight* reminds us that even in our darkest seasons, hope doesn’t vanish — it just waits for a little light to return. Sometimes, healing begins not with a miracle, but with a small gesture, a kind word, or a stranger’s quiet care. Even the smallest windows can open to infinite warmth if we dare to look toward the sun. 🌤️☀️ </p>
