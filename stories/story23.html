        Grocery shopping on a Sunday afternoon should be classified as a competitive sport.  
        I pulled into the packed parking lot, mentally preparing for battle.  
        Inside, the aisles buzzed with chaos—carts screeching, toddlers wailing, and someone debating out loud which brand of almond milk tastes the least like disappointment.
      </p>

      <p>
        My first event? **The Cart Squeeze.**  
        You know the one: two carts heading toward each other in a narrow aisle.  
        It’s a high-stakes game of chicken. Neither person moves. Both smile politely, pretending not to be annoyed, until finally, one of you performs an awkward three-point turn worthy of a forklift operator’s license.  
        Gold medal to the person who says “No worries!” while clearly seething inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next came **The Produce Sprint.**  
        The avocados were on sale, and judging by the stampede, this was serious business.  
        I snagged one, perfectly ripe, feeling like I’d just pulled Excalibur from the stone.  
        A woman next to me sighed dramatically and muttered, “Lucky,” as if I’d cheated the system.
      </p>

      <p>
        My cart was filling up fast, but I was feeling confident—until I hit **The Milk Gauntlet.**  
        Three carts were abandoned in front of the refrigerator section like someone had given up on life.  
        I had to limbo under a rogue shopping basket just to grab a carton of oat milk.  
        Olympic judges would have deducted points for lack of grace.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then, the **Final Boss Level:**  
        Choosing a checkout line. I scanned them all like a Vegas gambler.  
        Line 3 looked promising—just two people. Line 5 had four, but one was paying in cash, which meant doom.  
        I gambled on Line 3.  
        Ten minutes later, the person in front of me whipped out a folder of coupons and began a 45-minute negotiation with the cashier.  
        I aged three years waiting there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, I emerged into the sunlight, victorious but emotionally drained.  
        My groceries cost more than I’d budgeted, I forgot the one thing I actually came for,  
        and my cart had a squeaky wheel that now haunts my dreams.  
        But as I loaded my car, I realized: I had survived.  
        Next week, I might even try a weekday morning run.  
        Baby steps.
