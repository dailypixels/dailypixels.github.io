      <p>
        Rehan, an archaeologist, followed maps to the barren Thar Desert, chasing rumors of an ancient 
        caravan route lost beneath shifting sands. Local legends told of merchants who vanished during a 
        great storm, their wealth and wisdom swallowed by dunes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Days stretched into weeks as Rehan’s team unearthed fragments: pottery etched with unfamiliar 
        markings, bronze coins of distant kingdoms, and most curiously, a stone tablet describing a “caravan 
        that never returned.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, as twilight fell, Rehan wandered away from camp. The wind carried faint sounds — bells, 
        voices, and the shuffle of hooves. He turned, but the desert was empty. Yet when he pressed his ear to 
        the sand, the echoes grew louder, as if the caravan still marched beneath the surface of time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The discovery was never material treasure, but the realization that stories themselves are relics. The 
        desert kept its mysteries, but Rehan carried back a truth: civilizations may vanish, but their echoes live 
        in the sands, waiting for ears to listen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, his book *Echoes of the Desert Caravan* inspired travelers, historians, and poets alike. And 
        in the silence of every desert night, he swore he could still hear the bells of the caravan moving toward 
        an unseen horizon.
