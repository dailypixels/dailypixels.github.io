      <p>
       The village called it <b>Cloudspire</b>, a mountain so tall its peak was hidden most of the year. Everyone said it couldn’t be climbed — avalanches, storms, sheer cliffs. “Even the sky refuses visitors,” the elders joked.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Aria couldn’t stop staring at it. Not because she believed she could conquer it, but because she wanted to try.
      </p>

      <p>
        She set out with little more than a pack of food, a rope, and her stubborn heart. The first days were easy — meadows of wildflowers, streams singing over rocks. Then the path grew steep, the air thin, the nights cold. Many times she thought about turning back.
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, exhausted and shivering beneath a narrow ledge, she carved three words into the stone with her knife: <b>“One step more.”</b> That became her rule. Not the whole mountain, not even the day ahead — just one step more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks later, bruised and worn, Aria pulled herself onto the summit. The world stretched beneath her, oceans of cloud rolling like tides, the horizon endless. She laughed until her voice cracked. The mountain hadn’t been conquered — but neither had she.
      </p>

<p>
  When she returned to the village, people asked how she managed it. Aria only smiled: “The mountain never asked for all of me. Just the next step.”
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  Great challenges aren’t won in leaps, but in steady persistence. Every “impossible” journey is only a collection of small steps taken with faith.
