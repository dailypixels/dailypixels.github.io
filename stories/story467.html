      <p>
        The two fishing villages had lived on neighboring islands for centuries but rarely spoke. Old disputes about territory and fish stock had hardened into silence. Ferries passed without greetings. Families grew up never meeting those across the narrow strait.
      </p>

      <p>
        One stormy season, boats capsized, and supplies ran thin. A young boy from one island was rescued by strangers from the other. His gratitude cracked open years of resentment. Elders convened and agreed, tentatively, to try something bold: build a wooden bridge between the islands.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project began with suspicion. People argued over who should provide planks, nails, or ropes. But as beams rose from the water, something shifted. Children played together on the half-built bridge. Women traded recipes while hauling stones. Men who had once avoided eye contact now worked shoulder to shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>
        By midsummer, the bridge stood complete. On its first day, two weddings crossed it, binding families from both islands. Markets expanded. Laughter carried across the strait. The bridge had cost sweat and compromise, but it paid back in friendship and hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, when asked why they built it, the elders said: *“Because storms will always come. But if we stand apart, we drown. Together, we can weather anything.”*
