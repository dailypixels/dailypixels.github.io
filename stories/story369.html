        Every morning, Theo wrote a note to the sun. Some were simple: *“Thank you for warmth.”* Others were prayers, hopes, or little wishes. He folded them carefully and placed them in a jar by the window.

      <p>
        Days turned to weeks, and though no one else knew, Theo felt lighter, happier. The act of gratitude and reflection infused his life with small miracles. Birds perched near the jar, the light warmed his skin, and he noticed smiles from neighbors passing by.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, he found a note slipped under his door: *“Your letters inspire me.”* Smiling, Theo realized that hope spreads quietly, like sunlight filtering through leaves—sometimes seen, sometimes felt, always powerful.
