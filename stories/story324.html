        The map had been tucked inside an old book at the market, its edges brittle with age. To most, it was a curiosity. To Leah, an archaeologist with a restless heart, it was a call. The markings hinted at ruins lost in the Amazon, places untouched for centuries.

        She followed the twisting rivers, the canopy swallowing light, her compass nearly useless. Guides turned back, but Leah pressed on, hearing whispers of stone structures hidden by vines. The jungle tested her with storms, insects, and nights of doubt.

Inside, murals told stories of a people who mapped stars with startling accuracy. The forgotten map had not just led her to ruins—it had revealed a history of brilliance.
