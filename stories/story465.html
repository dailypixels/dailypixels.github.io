      <p>
        Yonah arrived at the forge with mud on his shoes and questions in his pockets. The Master, an old smith with arms like braided rope, handed him a metal rod and said simply: "Shape it." Yonah worked and failed; the metal cracked, bent, and spat sparks that sent him stumbling backward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Days passed. The Master rarely spoke. When he did, it was to point out small things: the angle of the hammer, the breath before a strike, the patience to wait until the metal softened with heat. Yonah learned to listen — to the rhythm of the bellows, to the metal’s sighs, and to the silence between instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        One night, when a cold wind rose from the river, a fire began at a neighboring warehouse. Flames licked high and fearless. The town panicked. Yonah watched the Master unhook a water cart and move, methodically, without show. Yonah rushed forward, instincts and fear battling; he wanted to do everything at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Master guided him gently: "One breath. One stroke. One bucket." Together they formed a line; together they acted not in frenzy but with purpose. The blaze was fought not by heroism but by steady work — each person filling buckets, placing them, pulling back for the next. Yonah learned then that bravery is not the loud front of risk but the quiet willingness to keep doing what is needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the flames died, the town rebuilt what was lost. Yonah's hands were blistered, and his arms ached, but his chest held a new steadiness. The Master later placed a small, cooled horseshoe in his palm — a token not of perfection, but of apprenticeship completed: a recognition that craft is patience, and growth comes from repetition, humility, and the courage to keep working when mistakes scatter like sparks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yonah kept the horseshoe by his bed. In the years that followed, he became the type of smith who taught the same small lessons: angle, breath, patience. When apprentices asked him what bravery meant, he'd smile and point to the horseshoe — and to the steady line of people ready to pass buckets when the town needed them most.
