      <p>
        Marco and I grew up on opposite sides of the river.  
        The only way across was a shaky old bridge,  
        patched with rope and wood we scavenged as kids.  
        Every plank we nailed together became a memory.  
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time we were teenagers,  
        the bridge was more than wood and rope—  
        it was a promise.  
        A place where we met after fights,  
        where secrets were exchanged,  
        and where silence was safe.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Life, as it often does, pulled us apart.  
        Marco chased work in the city,  
        while I stayed behind to care for family.  
        Years passed, and the bridge rotted.  
        So did the distance between us.  
      </p>

      <p>
        One autumn evening,  
        I found Marco waiting on the riverbank.  
        No words, just the same smile I remembered.  
        Together, with older hands but the same spirit,  
        we rebuilt the bridge—  
        each nail driving us back into friendship.  
      </p>

      <p>
        When the final plank was set,  
        we stood in the middle,  
        watching the sun sink into the water.  
        Sometimes the strongest bonds  
        aren’t spoken—they’re built.
