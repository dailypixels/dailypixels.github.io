      <p>
        In a dusty drawer of an old library, Asim discovered a bundle of letters tied with faded ribbon. None were addressed, none were sent. Each carried words of longing, apologies, and confessions of love that had never reached their destination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Intrigued, he read them one by one. They spoke of a girl named Meher, of stolen glances in lecture halls, of promises written but never spoken aloud. The letters were not about romance alone; they were a record of fear—the fear of rejection, of timing, of missed chances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Asim couldn’t help but wonder what became of the writer. Did he move on? Did Meher ever know? Or did both carry an emptiness shaped like an unsent letter?
      </p>

      <p>
        The discovery left Asim unsettled, until he realized the lesson within: that silence can cost more than rejection, and that love unsaid is still love wasted. He went home that night and wrote his own letter—not to be hidden, not to be tied away, but to be delivered.
