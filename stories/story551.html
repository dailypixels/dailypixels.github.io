      <p>
        Thomas had spent thirty years surrounded by the quiet ticking of clocks. His shop was filled with them — tall grandfather clocks, delicate pocket watches, cuckoos that chirped on the hour. To him, repairing them wasn’t just work; it was a way of honoring time itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        One rainy afternoon, the bell above the door chimed, and a woman entered holding a small silver watch. Its hands were frozen at 3:12.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It belonged to my mother,” she said softly. “But it hasn’t worked in years.”
      </p>
<p>
Thomas took the watch gently, as if it were something living. Over the next few days, he worked carefully, polishing gears, realigning springs, coaxing the mechanism back to life. Yet each time it ticked, it stopped again — always at 3:12.
</p>
<p>
Perplexed, he asked her about it. She smiled faintly. “That was the time my parents first met. Maybe it’s just… staying there.”
</p>
<p>
The simplicity of it stirred something in Thomas. He invited her to return often, not only to check on the watch, but to sit among the clocks, sipping tea as the hours passed. Their conversations stretched from minutes to evenings, and he began to feel time differently — not as something to measure, but as something to share.
</p>
<p>
Finally, on a quiet morning, he made one last adjustment. The watch began to tick steadily, its hands moving forward for the first time in years. He handed it back with a nervous smile.
</p>
<p>
She looked at him, eyes glistening. “Then maybe this is the time for us.”
</p>
<p>
  From that day on, Thomas no longer worked alone. The clocks still ticked faithfully, but their sound was joined by laughter, warmth, and the quiet rhythm of two lives moving forward together.
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  Love doesn’t erase the past — it restores the courage to let time move again. Some moments are worth remembering, but the most precious are the ones that carry us into new beginnings.
