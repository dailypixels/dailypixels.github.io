        In his final years, the poet Shun lived quietly in a small coastal town. He stopped publishing, though he still wrote each dawn in the same leather-bound notebook he had carried since youth.

        After his passing, the townspeople expected his last words to be heavy, philosophical. But when the notebook was opened, it contained short verses about seashells, laughter, morning tea, and neighbors’ kindness.
      </p>

        It became clear: Shun’s legacy was not grand theories, but the beauty of ordinary moments. His final gift was a reminder that poetry is not reserved for great epics — it is found in the quiet rhythm of daily life.
