        After months of burnout, Arjun traveled to a hilltop temple in northern India. The monks there spoke little, their silence louder than words. At dawn, bells rang softly, echoing through the valley. The world seemed to pause, offering him breath.

        One monk handed Arjun a broom, gesturing toward the stone courtyard. As he swept, he realized the act was not about cleanliness—it was meditation in motion. Each fallen leaf was a thought released, each sweep a small letting go.

        Days passed. Arjun stopped asking for answers and instead listened to the wind through the pines. In stillness, he discovered a truth: peace was not something to be found but remembered.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he finally left, the monk pressed his palms together and said simply, “Carry the quiet with you.” Arjun smiled, lighter than he had in years.
