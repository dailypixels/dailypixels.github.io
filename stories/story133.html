      <p><strong>Part I: The Withered Garden</strong></p>

<p>The village of Kiranpur hadn’t seen rain in five years. The once-green hills had turned to shades of rust and ash, and the river that once sang through the valley now slept in silence. People left one by one, searching for cities that still breathed water.</p>

<p>But one man stayed — <strong>Hafeez the gardener</strong>. His garden, once the pride of the village, had become a graveyard of roots. Every morning, he still carried two buckets of dust-colored water to sprinkle over cracked soil. “If I stop,” he told the children who watched him, “the earth will forget what kindness feels like.”</p>

<p>Among those children was <strong>Laila</strong>, a curious twelve-year-old who often followed him. One evening, when Hafeez’s cough turned heavy and his steps slow, he called her to his small hut by the garden. From an old wooden box, he took out a tiny cloth bundle and placed it in her hands.</p>

<p>“It’s a seed,” he said. “The last one I saved from the year the rains stopped. Don’t plant it yet. Wait until the sky remembers mercy.”</p>

<p>Laila nodded, though she didn’t understand. That night, Hafeez passed away in his sleep, and the villagers buried him beside the dry fig tree he once loved.</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The Waiting Years</strong></p>

<p>Laila grew up in a world of scarcity. By the time she turned twenty, the fields were empty, and even hope felt like a forgotten season. Yet she kept the seed — wrapped in the same cloth, tucked into her satchel wherever she went. People mocked her for it. “What’s the point?” they’d say. “No seed grows in stone.”</p>

<p>But on nights when the wind howled and dust coated her window, she would take it out, whispering, “You’re still alive. I know you are.”</p>

<p>Then, one morning, the air changed. A faint scent of wet soil drifted across the horizon. It wasn’t much — just a drizzle, quick and shy — but to Laila, it was enough. She ran to the old garden, her heart racing, and dug her fingers into the ground where Hafeez used to stand.</p>

<p>She planted the seed with trembling hands and whispered the same words she’d heard long ago: “The earth remembers kindness.”</p>

<p><strong>Part III: The First Leaf</strong></p>

<p>Days passed. The rain didn’t return. The villagers laughed again. “She’s gone mad, watering dirt!” they said.</p>

<p>Laila ignored them. Every dawn, she carried a small pot of water from her home and poured it over the patch of soil. On the thirtieth morning, as the sun rose, she saw it — a tiny sprout, no bigger than her thumb, reaching up through the cracked earth.</p>

<p>Her breath caught. It was alive.</p>

<p>Word spread quickly. The villagers gathered around the miracle, touching the green leaf as though it were a sacred relic. Laila smiled quietly, feeling something awaken not just in the soil — but in the people. They began cleaning their abandoned fields, collecting rainwater, planting again. The drought didn’t end overnight, but the despair did.</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Garden Returns</strong></p>

<p>Years later, the valley bloomed once more. Trees shaded the dusty paths, and flowers swayed where only stones once lay. In the center of the garden stood a great fig tree — grown from Hafeez’s last seed. Its roots were deep, its branches wide, its fruit sweet enough to make children laugh again.</p>

<p>Every spring, Laila would gather the first fallen figs, take their seeds, and hand them to the next generation. “Don’t plant them all,” she would say with a smile. “Always save one — for the day the sky forgets mercy again.”</p>

<p>And so, the cycle continued — not just of growth, but of faith.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Seed</em> is a story of endurance — of believing in renewal even when all evidence points to despair. It reminds us that hope is not the absence of hardship but the courage to keep nurturing life when the world seems barren. Every small act of care plants something greater than we can see — the promise that tomorrow can bloom again. 🌱💧</p>
