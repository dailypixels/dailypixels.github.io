    <main class="story-content">
     <p>When Eleanor Mayhew first arrived at Armitage Hall in the autumn of 1919, the manor stood silent, its windows dimmed, its gardens overgrown. The Great War had ended less than a year ago, but its echo lingered in every empty room and unspoken grief.</p>

<p>She had come to catalog the library for the late Lord Armitage — an old family friend of her father’s — whose only son, Captain Henry Armitage, had been reported missing in France. His mother still lit a candle for him each night on the stairwell, waiting for footsteps that would never return.</p>

<p>On her third day, while dusting a shelf behind the great desk, Eleanor found a narrow slit in the wood. Inside it lay a small stack of folded papers bound with a faded blue ribbon. The first was dated <em>April 1916</em>.</p>

<p><strong>“My Dearest Lila,</strong><br>
The guns have not stopped for days. I dream of the garden outside your ward, the lavender you planted before I left. If ever I return, I will build you a cottage where no one speaks of war again…”</p>

<p>Eleanor read the letter twice. It was written in a steady hand, signed, <em>H.A.</em> — Henry Armitage. But the name “Lila” stirred no memory in her. Who was she? And why were the letters hidden?</p>

<hr>

<p>Over the following weeks, Eleanor found more — each tucked carefully into the crevices of furniture and beneath floorboards, as if someone had been desperate to preserve them but afraid to be discovered. They told the story of Henry’s secret love affair with Lila Carter, a nurse at St. Albans Hospital.</p>

<p>In one, Lila wrote:</p>

<p><em>“The matron says officers mustn’t fraternize with nurses, but how can the heart obey when it already belongs? Every time you leave for the front, I stand by the window long after your shadow fades.”</em></p>

<p>And Henry replied:</p>

<p><em>“If I fall, I want you to remember not the trenches, but the orchard where we first met — the way the wind caught your hair, the way you laughed when I tripped over your basket. Promise me you’ll live, even if I do not.”</em></p>

<hr>

<p>By the time Eleanor reached the final letter, her hands trembled.</p>

<p><em>“My beloved,</em><br>
<em>The order comes at dawn. The men are afraid, though none will say it. I have no right to ask, but if fate is cruel, and these words are all that remains, know that I loved you beyond duty, beyond reason, beyond the end of the world.”</em></p>

<p>It was dated July 1, 1916 — the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Henry Armitage was declared missing that same week.</p>

<p>But there was one more page, unsigned, written in a different hand:</p>

<p><em>“They told me Henry was gone, yet I still light a candle each night. For the flame reminds me — love does not vanish in the dark. It waits. It endures.”</em><br>
— <em>L.C.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Eleanor folded the letters carefully and returned them to their place in the desk. Outside, the first snow began to fall over the gardens, soft and silent. She imagined Lila walking those same paths years ago, waiting, hoping.</p>

<p>That evening, she placed a single candle by the window of the library — as Lady Armitage had done each night — and whispered into the quiet, “For them both.”</p>

<p>As the flame flickered, she thought she saw the faint outline of two figures standing hand in hand beyond the glass, watching the snow together at last.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Letters of Armitage Hall</em> is a story about memory and devotion — how love can survive even the silence of war and the passage of time. Some promises, though whispered in the past, still light the present. 🕯️💌</p>
