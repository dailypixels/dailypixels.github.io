      <p> It all began at exactly 9:04 a.m. — the sacred minute when the office coffee machine usually hissed to life like a dragon breathing purpose into the day. But not today. Today, it wheezed, blinked twice, and died with a sound that could only be described as “a sad robot burping.” </p> <p> Everyone froze. No one spoke. The air grew heavy with panic. Because in this office, coffee wasn’t just a drink — it was survival. </p> <p> At the center of the disaster stood <em>Arman</em> — the new intern, still clutching a plastic cup and wearing the expression of a man who had just accidentally launched a nuclear missile. </p> <p> “I just… pressed the button,” he stammered. “You pressed <em>all</em> the buttons,” said Zara from accounting, holding her empty mug like a weapon. “You activated espresso, cappuccino, and ‘self-cleaning’ at the same time!” </p> <p> The machine emitted one last gurgle before sputtering out a puff of steam — followed by a splash of lukewarm coffee that narrowly missed the boss’s white shirt. The room collectively gasped. </p> <p> Their boss, Mr. Kareem — a man whose blood type was probably Arabica — looked at the broken machine as though witnessing a fallen comrade. “Someone,” he said gravely, “find a solution before I start chewing coffee beans raw.” </p> <p> Within minutes, chaos erupted. Tariq from IT tried rewiring the machine with a USB cable. Sana from HR attempted to bribe a barista from the café downstairs with a donut. Meanwhile, Arman googled “how to apologize to 27 caffeine addicts without crying.” </p> <p> By 10 a.m., the situation was dire. People were whispering. Someone was nibbling on instant coffee powder like trail mix. A small rebellion was forming near the printer. </p> <p> Then, out of nowhere, salvation arrived — in the form of an old French press dug out from a dusty cabinet. It was cracked, squeaky, and smelled faintly of cinnamon and regret, but it worked. Arman volunteered to brew for everyone as an act of redemption. </p> <p> Unfortunately, Arman had never used a French press. What followed could only be described as a coffee-themed natural disaster. He poured boiling water without the lid, stirred with a pen, and somehow created a coffee volcano that erupted across three desks. But in the middle of the chaos, something amazing happened — everyone started laughing. Even Mr. Kareem, covered in a fine mist of mocha, chuckled and said, “Congratulations, intern. You’ve invented office art.” </p> <p> By noon, the office smelled like a coffee shop hit by a tornado, but morale had never been higher. They all sipped slightly gritty, over-brewed coffee together, cheering Arman for “services to caffeine and comedy.” Zara even made him a badge that said *Official Coffee Crisis Manager.* </p> <p> When the new machine finally arrived a week later, no one wanted to throw the old one away. Someone stuck googly eyes on it, and it now sits proudly in the break room — a heroic monument to teamwork, caffeine, and controlled chaos. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Coffee Catastrophe* reminds us that laughter can brew where pressure builds. Sometimes, a mistake is just an opportunity for people to come together — to find joy in the mess, and connection in the chaos. ☕😂 </p>
