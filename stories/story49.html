      <p>
        It was supposed to be a calm morning.  
        Just coffee, toast, and a quick scroll through emails.  
        But apparently, my coffee had other plans.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I poured the first cup, half-asleep,  
        and missed the mug entirely.  
        The coffee cascaded down the counter like a chocolate waterfall,  
        pooling neatly onto my laptop charger.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I scrambled for paper towels,  
        knocking over the sugar jar in the process.  
        Suddenly, it was like I’d opened a bakery on my kitchen floor.  
        The cat, sensing chaos, leapt onto the counter,  
        smearing little paw prints through the mess  
        before bolting off like a caffeinated rocket.  
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time I had cleaned it all up,  
        I’d somehow managed to burn the toast,  
        delete an important email,  
        and end up wearing a mismatched pair of socks  
        that I didn’t even own yesterday.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The moral?  
        Coffee may fuel mornings,  
        but today, it clearly wanted revenge.  
        Next time, I’m starting my day with water.  
        Less drama.
