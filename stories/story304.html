        In the heart of 14th-century Baghdad, Yusuf was a master calligrapher whose work adorned mosques and royal courts. His students admired the elegance of his lines, yet none knew of the secret message he had hidden across his manuscripts.

      <p>
        Every stroke, every flourish of his pen carried fragments of a poem dedicated to his late wife, Amina. To the world, it was scripture and wisdom; to Yusuf, it was love eternal, written invisibly between the verses.
      </p>

      <p>
