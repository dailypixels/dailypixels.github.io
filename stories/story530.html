        The stadium was empty now. Seats that once shook with chants stood silent, echoing with the ghosts of matches past. Former cricketer Sameer returned after years, walking slowly onto the pitch where his career had both risen and shattered.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had been a star until an injury ended everything. Fans moved on. Headlines forgot. But the ground remembered—the smell of turf, the roar of the crowd, the tears in defeat. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As he stood at the crease, he felt no bitterness. Only gratitude. “The game gave me more than it took,” he whispered. For the first time, the silence didn’t hurt—it healed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sameer left the stadium knowing that while his career was over, the echoes of the game would always belong to him.
