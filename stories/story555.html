      <p>
        Amelia always asked for the window seat. Watching the world blur by — fields, forests, rivers flashing past — calmed her in ways nothing else could.
      </p>

      <p>
        That evening, on the long ride home, she found her seat occupied by a young man staring intently out the glass. He glanced up apologetically. “Sorry, I didn’t realize this one was reserved.”
      </p>

      <p>
        She laughed softly. “It’s alright. Maybe we can share the view.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So they sat side by side, the hum of the train filling the silence. For a while, neither spoke, just watching as the sun dipped low, painting the sky in shades of fire and rose. Then he broke the quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Do you ever wonder how many lives we’re passing right now? All those lights, all those windows — and we’ll never know their stories.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Amelia smiled. “Maybe that’s why we sit by windows. To remind ourselves there’s more out there.”
      </p>
      <p>
        They talked through the evening — about favorite books, missed chances, silly childhood dreams. Each stop threatened to end the conversation, but neither seemed eager to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Amelia admitted she was traveling for a job interview she wasn’t sure she could handle, he leaned forward, eyes steady. “You wouldn’t be on this train if you weren’t ready. Sometimes the hardest journeys bring us exactly where we’re meant to be.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As the train slowed for her stop, Amelia hesitated. The thought of leaving felt heavier than it should after only a few hours. She gathered her courage and scribbled her number on the back of her ticket. Sliding it across the table, she whispered, “Maybe our windows don’t have to close here.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked down at the paper, then back at her with a smile that made the whole carriage feel brighter. “I’ll make sure they don’t.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Amelia stepped off the train into the cool night air, her heart light. For once, the world outside the window didn’t feel so far away.
      </p>

      <h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

      <p>
        Love often begins not with grand gestures, but with small, genuine moments. Sometimes a shared seat, a kind word, or a passing view is all it takes to open a window to something lasting.
