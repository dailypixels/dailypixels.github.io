        For ten years, Noor and her elder brother Haris shared the same house but barely exchanged words. Their father’s sudden passing had left them fractured — a single argument at the funeral escalated into a wall of silence neither dared to climb. Time passed, yet the silence became heavier than any words.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every Eid, every family dinner, every shared chore was marked by avoidance: one leaving the room when the other entered, polite nods replacing conversations. Their mother, worn down by the quiet war, placed two cups of tea on the dining table each night, hoping one evening they might sit and drink together.
      </p>

      <p>
        The turning point came unexpectedly. Noor discovered an old cassette tape in a drawer labeled: <em>“For my children.”</em> It was their father’s voice, tender and steady, urging them to look after one another, reminding them that love meant more than pride. His words were not angry, only gentle — as if he knew silence would follow him after death.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night Noor set both cups of tea on the table and pressed play. Haris walked in, drawn by the sound of their father’s voice. They sat opposite each other, listening to the man who had once held them both in his arms, his words weaving a bridge across the years of distance.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the tape clicked off, the silence remained — but it was no longer hostile. Noor whispered first, “I missed you.” Haris, blinking back tears, replied simply, “I missed you too.” It was not a grand reconciliation, but it was enough to begin healing.
