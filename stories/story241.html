    <main class="story-content">
      <p>The wind on K2 was unlike anything Daniel Frost had ever known. It wasn’t just cold—it was alive, shrieking like something ancient. His breath crystallized instantly, turning the air into silver mist as he tightened the rope around his harness.</p>

<p>“We’re close,” his Sherpa, Nima, said through chattering teeth. “Only one more ridge.”</p>

<p>Daniel nodded. Every step was agony. His oxygen was running low, his legs trembling, but this climb wasn’t just a conquest—it was a promise.</p>

<p>Two years ago, his brother, Mark, had vanished attempting the same ascent. They’d dreamed of reaching the summit together, but Daniel had backed out, calling it too dangerous. Mark went without him and never came back.</p>

<p>Now, Daniel was here—to finish what they’d started.</p>

<hr>

<p>The sky turned steel gray. Snow swirled like powdered glass. He pressed on, gripping the ice axe, the slope rising like the spine of the world before him. Every heartbeat thundered in his ears.</p>

<p>“We should turn back,” Nima warned. “Storm coming fast.”</p>

<p>Daniel looked up. Through the storm veil, the summit was just visible—a jagged crown of white stone. “No,” he whispered. “Not this time.”</p>

<p>He took another step, then another. Pain tore through his lungs, but beneath it was something else—a voice, soft and steady, like wind through snow. *You’ll see it one day, Danny. For both of us.*</p>

<p>He looked down at the patch sewn into his jacket: Mark’s name, embroidered beside a faded photo of them as boys, grinning with toy ice axes in their hands.</p>

<hr>

<p>By the time he reached the final ridge, the world had vanished in white. Nima was far behind. His radio was dead. Every sound was swallowed by the blizzard.</p>

<p>And yet—there it was. The summit marker, half-buried under snow, a few meters ahead. He dropped to his knees, crawling, every muscle screaming. The storm clawed at him, trying to tear him away.</p>

<p>“Mark,” he gasped, driving the flag into the frozen ground. “We made it.”</p>

<p>For a long time, he sat there, wrapped in silence. And through the white haze, he thought he saw someone standing across the ridge—a familiar silhouette, smiling before fading into the snow.</p>

<hr>

<p>When rescuers found him two days later, Daniel was alive, frostbitten but clutching his brother’s photo close to his heart. The flag was still standing at the summit—two names written across it, fluttering together in the wind.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Step to K2</em> is a story of redemption and love stronger than fear. True adventure isn’t about reaching the top—it’s about carrying someone’s memory high enough to touch the sky. When we climb for those we’ve lost, we never climb alone. 🏔️</p>
