      <p>
        Mondays were never easy for Jason,  
        but this one started out like a cruel joke.  
        His alarm didn’t go off,  
        his shirt had a stain he didn’t notice until  
        after the bus ride,  
        and worst of all—  
        he had a presentation to give at 9:00 AM sharp.
      </p>

      <p>
        By 8:53, Jason was sprinting into the office lobby,  
        clutching a paper cup of extra-large coffee,  
        because obviously he couldn’t face a room of executives  
        without it.  
        He dodged a security guard,  
        narrowly avoided colliding with the CEO’s dog-walker  
        (don’t ask),  
        and made it to the elevator with seconds to spare.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s when disaster struck.  
        The elevator doors opened,  
        a woman stepped out too quickly,  
        and Jason—like a slow-motion movie scene—  
        tripped over her rolling briefcase.  
        His coffee arced through the air like a golden fountain,  
        splashing directly across the company’s  
        brand-new touchscreen directory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The machine hissed,  
        flickered,  
        and displayed—  
        in giant glowing letters—  
        “REBOOTING SYSTEM… PLEASE WAIT.”  
        Employees waiting in line gasped.  
        Jason froze.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “You killed the directory,” the woman said,  
        her eyes wide with horror.  
        “Now no one knows what floor to go to!”  
      </p>

      <p>
        As if on cue, chaos erupted.  
        People wandered aimlessly,  
        asking strangers where Accounting was.  
        The IT guy shouted something about fried circuits.  
        The janitor pulled out a mop with the grim expression  
        of a man who had seen too much.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Jason, however, had no time to dwell.  
        He had seven minutes left before his presentation.  
        With coffee stains on his hands,  
        he bolted up the emergency stairwell,  
        counting floors like his life depended on it.  
      </p>

      <p>
        At 9:01, sweaty and disheveled,  
        Jason burst into the conference room.  
        Executives stared.  
        His boss raised an eyebrow.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “Rough morning?” she asked.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Jason smiled weakly and replied,  
        “You could say I just made the biggest splash  
        in company history.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        The room went silent.  
        Then—one chuckle, two chuckles,  
        and suddenly, the entire boardroom was laughing.  
        His boss wiped a tear from her eye and said,  
        “Alright, Jason. Let’s see if your presentation  
        is half as entertaining as your entrance.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        And somehow, against all odds,  
        it turned out to be the best presentation  
        of his career.
