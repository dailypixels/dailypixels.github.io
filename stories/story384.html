        When Noor walked into her small town’s garden center, she was surprised to see sunflowers still blooming, bright against the chill of December. She laughed softly, feeling warmth in the cold.

        Each flower seemed to whisper resilience, reminding her that even in difficult seasons, beauty and hope persist. She bought a small bouquet, placing them on her kitchen table.

        Every morning, Noor drank her tea beside the cheerful blooms, feeling joy seep into her spirit. She realized life’s brightness isn’t only in perfect timing—it’s in noticing small miracles even in winter’s gray.
