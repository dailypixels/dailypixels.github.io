        Elena and Sam had known each other since childhood, but life’s twists had pulled them in different directions. One chilly evening, a spontaneous text from Sam changed everything: “Meet me on the rooftop—city lights, old stories, new beginnings.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As Elena climbed the fire escape, memories of scraped knees, midnight adventures, and laughter echoed through her mind. The city skyline glittered above them, but it was the familiarity of Sam’s grin that lit her heart.

        They spent hours sharing dreams, regrets, and silly jokes that only they understood. The world below bustled with people chasing their own routines, but up there, time slowed. In that moment, they realized that true friendship withstands distance, challenges, and change.
      </p>

        When the first light of dawn touched the skyline, Elena turned to Sam and said, “No matter where life takes us, we’ll always find our way back to nights like this.” Sam smiled, “Exactly. Here’s to countless more rooftops, stories, and laughter.” Their hearts were lighter, their bond stronger, and the city had never felt more alive.
