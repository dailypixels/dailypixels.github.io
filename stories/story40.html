     <p> On the morning the rain forgot to fall, **Lysa** woke to a sound no one else heard — a hum coming from the clouds. <br><br> Her village was small, built along the cliffs of *Aurelion Ridge*, where fog lingered like old secrets. Every evening, she’d sit by the edge and watch the sky, waiting for something she couldn’t name. </p> <p> That day, she saw it — a shimmer beyond the mist, a stairway of light curling upward into the clouds. People said such things were illusions, tricks of tired eyes. But Lysa’s heart didn’t believe in tricks. So she climbed. </p> <p> Step after glowing step, the world below faded, replaced by silence and wind that smelled of silver rain. When she reached the top, she found herself standing on a floating bridge that led to a city unlike any she had ever imagined — spires made of glass and stone, rivers that glowed with starlight, and creatures with wings like spun gold. <br><br> A voice greeted her: <br> *"Welcome home, Princess Lysa of Aetherion."* </p> <p> She froze. *"There’s been a mistake,"* she said. *"I’m not a princess. I’m from the cliffs — the lower world."* <br><br> The being before her — tall, robed in light — smiled. *"Memory is fragile between worlds. But your heart remembers. Follow it."* </p> <p> In the days that followed, Lysa wandered the Kingdom Beneath the Clouds, learning its forgotten magic. She could command the wind, speak to storms, and walk across moonlight. But at night, she dreamed of her village — her mother’s laughter, her brother’s shadow in the rain. And she wondered: if this was home, why did she still long for there? </p> <p> The High Oracle summoned her one morning, revealing the truth. Long ago, the kingdoms of *Earth* and *Aetherion* had been one — until humans sealed the sky to stop the wars of magic. To protect balance, a princess was sent below, her memories hidden, her destiny delayed. <br><br> *"You are that princess,"* said the Oracle. *"And the stairway opened because the balance is breaking again."* </p> <p> Lysa stood at the edge of the sky bridge that night, torn between two worlds. If she stayed, she would rule Aetherion. If she returned, she could save her people — but lose the magic she’d just rediscovered. <br><br> The clouds shimmered, whispering both comfort and sorrow. </p> <p> She looked down and saw her village — the people building fires, calling out her name. Then she looked up — to the kingdom calling her queen. <br><br> Lysa closed her eyes and stepped forward. Into the storm. </p> <p> When she opened them again, she stood on the cliffs once more — but the sky above her was no longer silent. Rain fell again for the first time in a hundred days, each drop glowing faintly with light. <br><br> The kingdom above had vanished, but she felt it in her heart — like a promise kept. And in the distance, thunder rolled softly, as if bowing to her choice. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Kingdom Beneath the Clouds* speaks of **belonging, courage, and the duality of the soul** — that part of us that yearns for wonder yet is bound by love to the world below. It reminds us that magic isn’t found in escape but in **returning changed**, carrying a piece of the impossible back to where it’s most needed. <br><br> Every dreamer who’s ever looked at the sky and felt “something calling” — that’s your Aetherion. And the climb begins the moment you listen. ☁️✨ </p>
