        The old hotel was silent, except for the rain ticking against its cracked windows.  
        I dragged my suitcase down the faded red carpet, each step sinking slightly as if the building itself was tired.  
        The clerk’s warning replayed in my mind: *“Don’t go past Room 313.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        The hallway smelled faintly of dust and smoke. Most of the doors were closed, their numbers tarnished by years of neglect.  
        But at the very end, there was one door without a number—slightly ajar, light flickering from within.  
        My curiosity outweighed my common sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        I pushed it open. The room was empty, save for a single chair beneath a flickering bulb and a mirror leaning  
        against the far wall. My reflection stared back, but something was wrong—my reflection wasn’t moving.  
        It just stood there, smiling faintly.
      </p>

      <p>
        A chill ran down my spine. I turned to leave, but the door slammed shut.  
        The reflection raised its hand and waved slowly, then stepped out of the mirror as if it had been waiting.  
        I stumbled backward, tripping over the chair, heart pounding.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve been waiting for you,” it said.  
        Its voice was mine, but sharper. More certain.  
        And as it stepped closer, I realized I wasn’t in control anymore.  
        The reflection smiled wider, reaching for me, and the world went dark.
