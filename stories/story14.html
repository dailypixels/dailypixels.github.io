      <p>
        I first saw the bench on a cold morning in November. It was empty, facing the lake like a quiet invitation.  
        The air smelled faintly of pine and wet earth, and a thin layer of mist hovered over the water.  
        I was exhausted that day—tired of my routine, my job, and the weight I’d been carrying for months.
      </p>

      <p>
        I sat down and stared at the ripples dancing across the lake. That’s when an older man approached,  
        his steps slow but steady. He smiled politely, then asked if he could sit. I nodded, and we watched the  
        water in silence for a few minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s my favorite view in the whole world,” he finally said. His voice was warm, almost like a story itself.  
        “My wife and I used to come here every Sunday. She loved watching the sunsets.”  
        He paused, his eyes soft but heavy with memory. “She’s gone now, but I still come. Because she’d want me to.”
      </p>

      <p>
        His words lingered in the crisp air. He turned to me and asked gently, “What’s on your mind, son?”  
        I hesitated, then told him everything—about the job I hated, the family I felt disconnected from, the way  
        I’d been walking through life without really living it.
      </p>

      <p>
        He listened, really listened, and when I finished, he said something I’ll never forget:  
        *“You don’t have to change the world all at once. Start by changing the day you’re in. One good day leads to another.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        We sat there until the mist burned away and the sunlight sparkled on the lake.  
        When I left, I felt lighter, as if his words had carved a path forward.  
        I came back a week later, hoping to see him again, but the bench was empty.  
        There was only a small plaque I hadn’t noticed before:  
        *“In memory of Eleanor and Samuel Hayes. Love is eternal.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        I realized then that some people enter your life just long enough to change it.  
        I still visit that bench, not out of sadness, but gratitude. Because now, every time I sit there,  
        I remember his words—and I make sure to change at least one day at a time.
