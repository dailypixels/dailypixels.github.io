      <p> The rain had been falling since afternoon, the kind that turns streets into mirrors. <br><br> When I ducked into the café, I only wanted warmth — a place to dry my hands, a cup of coffee, a pause before the next train. <br> But then I saw him. </p> <p> He sat by the window — same gray sweater, same careful posture, same book he used to carry everywhere: <em>“Letters to a Young Poet.”</em> <br> For a moment, I thought time had folded itself, placing me back five years ago, before everything changed. </p> <p> His name was **Rahil**. <br> We had once shared everything — dreams, silences, unfinished goodbyes. <br> The last time I saw him, he was walking away under this same kind of rain, saying, <em>“Maybe love is about learning when to let go.”</em> </p> <p> I never argued, though I wanted to. I thought silence would keep the peace. <br> But silence only kept the distance. </p> <p> Now, sitting a few tables away, I watched him turn pages slowly, his fingers tracing the edges like he was afraid the story might end. <br> He hadn’t noticed me — or maybe he had, and just didn’t want to look back. </p> <p> The waiter came over. “Would you like to sit near the window?” he asked. <br> I hesitated, then nodded. </p> <p> Rahil finally looked up. His eyes widened — not in shock, not even surprise — but in recognition, like someone remembering a half-forgotten melody. <br> “You’re late,” he said softly, smiling. “I ordered your favorite coffee anyway.” </p> <p> My heart stumbled. He still remembered. The rain fell harder outside, but inside, everything slowed — the world shrinking to the space between us. </p> <p> “Do you still believe love is about letting go?” I asked. <br> He paused, looking at his reflection in the window. “I used to,” he said. “Now I think love is about returning — even if it takes years.” <br> The clock above the counter ticked softly, marking the time we’d lost — and found again. </p> <p> We talked until the rain stopped. No dramatic apologies, no tears. Just laughter between pauses, and comfort in the small, ordinary moments. <br> When I finally left, I realized — maybe some goodbyes aren’t endings. <br> They’re just promises waiting for the right moment to come true. </p>

      <h2>
Meaning / Reflection:
      </h2>

<p>
Love doesn’t always live in grand gestures. Sometimes, it survives quietly — in a familiar corner, a remembered order, a rainy evening that chooses to repeat itself.
Some hearts aren’t lost; they’re just waiting for time to circle back.
