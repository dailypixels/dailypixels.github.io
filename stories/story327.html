        Travelers avoided the old Marwick Hotel. Locals swore the walls whispered at night. But Julian, a writer hungry for material, checked in, notebook in hand. The receptionist gave him a key without a word, her eyes hollow.

      <p>
        That night, as Julian wrote, he heard faint voices. At first, they seemed like echoes of conversations long past—laughter, weeping, arguments. But then they began to call his name. The wallpaper rippled as though something moved beneath it.
      </p>

        When he tried to leave, the hallway stretched impossibly, doors multiplying. The whispers grew louder, overlapping until they formed a single demand: “Stay.” His notebook fell, pages flipping on their own, words scrawling themselves in ink he had not written.
      </p>

      <p>
        By morning, the room was empty. Only the notebook remained on the desk, open to a fresh story—Julian’s last.
