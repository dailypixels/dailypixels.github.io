      <p>
        The night was heavy with silence, but morning stitched gold into the sky.  
        Dawn arrived not with thunder, but with threads—gentle, woven, patient.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Amina wrote these lines at her window, watching light dissolve the dark. For her, poetry wasn’t about rhyme but revelation—capturing what words could barely contain. She believed mornings were reminders that even the deepest night had an end.
      </p>

      <p>
        She shared her verses with strangers, leaving them on café tables, bus stops, and tucked inside library books. Some readers smiled, some wept, some carried the scraps in their wallets like talismans. Each word was a thread, binding her to lives she would never know.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the anniversary of her father’s death, Amina left a poem at his grave: *You are not gone, only transformed into light.* A passerby found it and left a reply—two lines of gratitude, scrawled in shaky handwriting. That reply was more precious than applause, proof that poetry had reached where speeches could not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dawn comes for all. But some, like Amina, teach us to see it—not as a time of day, but a promise of renewal.
