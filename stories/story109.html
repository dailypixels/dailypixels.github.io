        Every small action carries weight. This lesson came to Jonah unexpectedly one quiet afternoon.  
        Walking along the river, he tossed a stone into the water and watched the ripples spread outward.  
        He realized that every choice, word, and deed sends waves into the lives of others, far beyond what he could see.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired, Jonah began to approach life with intention.  
        He offered help to colleagues, encouraged strangers, and spent time nurturing relationships that mattered.  
        At first, the changes seemed minor, but over time, he noticed a transformation—small acts creating positive ripples in ways he never anticipated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Months later, a friend returned the favor unexpectedly, another colleague cited his encouragement in success,  
        and strangers thanked him for gestures that seemed tiny at the moment.  
        Jonah realized that impact isn’t always immediate or visible—it’s cumulative, like ripples merging across the water.
      </p>

      <p>
        This insight reshaped how Jonah lived.  
        He understood that even in uncertainty, consistent acts of kindness, courage, and integrity matter.  
        One ripple can meet another, creating a wave that touches lives beyond imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        And so, Jonah walked forward each day, mindful of the stones he dropped,  
        knowing that the world is shaped not only by grand gestures but also by the subtle, persistent ripples of thoughtful actions.
