        The market smelled of cumin and warm bread. An old man sat by the alley entrance with a tiny cardboard sign: *“Just returned. Little money.”* His hands were steady but scarred; his eyes kept watch of passersby as if counting each face as a promise.
      </p>

        Mina moved through the crowd carrying a bag of vegetables, the day's list running like a small drum in her head. She noticed the man and remembered how her father once taught her that small moments were the scaffolding of the world. On impulse, she set down two coins beside him and a matchbox she had tucked in her pocket for no reason she could name.
      </p>

      <p>
        The man looked up, surprised, then laughed softly, a sound like someone remembering a good song. He picked up the coins, then the matchbox — which, when opened, revealed dozens of tiny notes folded like petals. Each note contained a short line: *“You are seen.”* *“Sit a while.”* *“Rest.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        Mina watched as he read. Tears caught in the corner of his eyes. He tapped the matchbox lid once, closed it, and handed it back to her. "Keep it," he said. "The matchbox holds what I collect — small lights people leave behind." He smiled, richer in a way coins could not measure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mina walked home lighter. The day felt different, as though two small acts — coins and a matchbox — had shifted the orbit of more than one life. That night she opened the matchbox and unfolded a note for herself: *“You are seen.”* She put it by her bedside and slept as if the world had promised to look back gently.
