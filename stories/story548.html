        In the mountain town of Skardu, Amina inherited her grandmother’s loom — a massive wooden frame etched with generations of fingerprints. Each thread she pulled whispered a story: migrations, harvests, weddings, and winters survived.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tourists saw only a rug; Amina saw a language of color and patience. The reds spoke of courage, the blues of rivers, the yellows of festivals under sunlit skies. With each rug sold, she tucked a hidden signature into the weave: two threads crossed like an embrace.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, a visitor returned with tears in his eyes. He had bought her rug years ago, and it had become a family heirloom, passed to his daughter on her wedding day. He had come only to thank her — for weaving not cloth, but memory itself.
