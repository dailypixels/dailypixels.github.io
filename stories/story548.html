    <main class="story-content">
      <p>
        The town of Arindel had no stars. Not because the sky was empty, but because the lanterns lining every street shone so brightly that no one bothered to look up.
      </p>

      <p>
        They burned night and day, never fading, never dimming. People said they were lit centuries ago by the first Lantern Keeper — a woman who stole fire from the gods to keep the darkness at bay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lyra had grown up beneath their glow, but she always wondered: what made them burn so endlessly?
      </p>
      <p>
        One evening, restless, she reached for the lantern outside her door. The moment her fingers brushed the glass, a surge of warmth pulled her into light. Suddenly, she wasn’t standing on her street — she was in a meadow, bathed in moonlight, watching her late mother hum a lullaby she hadn’t heard since childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lyra gasped. When she blinked, she was back in the street, her hand trembling.
      </p>
      <p>
        She tried another lantern the next night. This time, she stood on a mountain peak beside a man she’d never met, laughing as the wind tore through their hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each lantern revealed a memory — some hers, some belonging to strangers long gone. Joy, sorrow, heartbreak, triumph. It was as if the town’s entire history had been captured in flame, woven together so no one would ever truly be forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
Finally, Lyra reached the largest lantern, the one in the square. Its light was dimmer than the rest, flickering like a breath about to vanish. She touched it, and the world fell silent.
      </p>
      <p>
A voice, soft but steady, whispered: “When the last lantern fades, the stars will return. Until then, we keep watch.”
      </p>
<p>
  The glow died, and the square was plunged into darkness. For the first time in centuries, the townspeople lifted their heads — and gasped.
</p>
<p>
Above them, the night sky blazed with constellations they had forgotten existed.
</p>
<p>
  Lyra smiled through her tears. The lanterns had never been meant to replace the stars. They had only waited until the people were ready to see the sky again.
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  The story reminds us that light can guide us, but it should never blind us. Sometimes, we must let go of the comforts that shield us to rediscover the beauty waiting above.
