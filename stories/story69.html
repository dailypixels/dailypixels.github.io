      <p>
        The building was ordinary from the outside,  
        a stack of red-brick apartments that had seen better days.  
        But inside, whispers spread about **Apartment 9B**.  
        Tenants swore they heard voices through the walls,  
        even when the place was empty.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Detective Alvarez didn’t believe rumors.  
        But when a young woman disappeared after moving in,  
        and the landlord insisted no one had rented 9B in years,  
        he couldn’t ignore it.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The apartment smelled of dust and damp wood.  
        Faded wallpaper hung in strips,  
        and in the center of the living room,  
        a single chair faced the wall.  
        On it sat a tape recorder.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Alvarez pressed play.  
        Static filled the air,  
        then a woman’s voice whispered:  
        *“He’s watching. Don’t look at the door.”*  
      </p>

      <p>
        His pulse quickened.  
        He turned toward the door anyway.  
        Nothing. Just a rusty knob and chipped paint.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The voice returned, louder now:  
        *“You looked. He knows. Run.”*  
      </p>

      <p>
        Alvarez spun around.  
        The tape recorder wasn’t on the chair anymore—  
        it was in the corner, still playing.  
        His breath caught.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The front door slammed shut.  
        He pulled at the knob, but it wouldn’t budge.  
        Then, from the other side of the door,  
        came a whisper in his own voice:  
        *“Welcome to 9B.”*  
      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning,  
        the landlord swore the apartment was still empty.  
        But the neighbors said they heard something new  
        through the walls that night—  
        a man’s voice, calling for help,  
        over and over again.
