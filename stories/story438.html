        The old park smelled of grass and summer. A group of friends sat in a circle, playing a game that had been a tradition for years. Laughter erupted, spilling over like sunlight through the trees.

        Memories mingled with the present: mischief, secrets, shared triumphs, and tiny heartbreaks. Each laugh was a thread, weaving them together across time. Even those who had moved away, who couldn’t be there today, seemed present in the echoes of their laughter.
