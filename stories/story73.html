      <p>
        Sophia never believed in fate, but the letters changed everything.  
        They arrived one by one, tucked inside her old mailbox,  
        written in handwriting she hadn’t seen in years.  
        It was Daniel’s—her first love,  
        the boy she thought she had lost forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        They had parted in college,  
        promises drowned beneath the weight of ambition.  
        She built her life in the city,  
        chasing deadlines and promotions.  
        He left for the coast, where the sea  
        was both his solace and his prison.
      </p>

      <p>
        The letters were dated years ago,  
        each one telling a story—  
        of longing, regret, and love  
        that refused to die.  
        She read them in the quiet of her apartment,  
        tears smudging the ink as if Daniel himself  
        were crying with her.
      </p>

      <p>
        One night, a storm raged outside.  
        The latest letter was short:  
        *“If you ever forgive me,  
        meet me at the station where we last said goodbye.”*  
        Her heart pounded as thunder shook the sky.  
        Without hesitation, she ran through the rain.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the old train station,  
        she found him waiting—  
        soaked, older, but unmistakably him.  
        He held the final letter in his hand.  
        “I never stopped writing to you,” he whispered.  
        “I just never thought you’d read them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Sophia pressed her forehead against his chest,  
        rain and tears indistinguishable.  
        “And I never stopped loving you.”  
        The storm softened as if the heavens themselves  
        had been waiting for this reunion.  
      </p>

      <p>
        They stood there, two souls stitched back together  
        by words carried across time,  
        by letters in the rain.  
      </p>
