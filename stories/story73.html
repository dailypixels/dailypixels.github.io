     <p> When the old satellite finally fell from orbit, it sent a storm of static across the world. In the noise, a single message was found — an ancient text transmission, never delivered. </p> <p> *“I forgive you.”* <p> It was dated **June 12, 2035** — ten years in the future. The sender’s name was blurred by radiation interference, but one thing was clear: the signal had been bouncing through space all this time, searching for someone still listening. </p> <p> Somewhere, in a quiet apartment overlooking a sleeping city, an old woman’s phone lit up. Her trembling hand opened it — and for a moment, time folded gently around her. </p> <p> “He kept his promise,” she whispered. Then, smiling through tears, she turned off the light. </p>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Last Message* is about time, regret, and the strange persistence of love. Even when technology decays and signals fade, emotion can still travel — finding its way home across years and silence. ⚡💔</p>
