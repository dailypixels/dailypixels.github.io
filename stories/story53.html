     <p> When I was six, I used to sit outside my father’s study door every night. The rule was simple: when the light under the door went out, I had to sleep. But I never could. The soft glow spilling across the floor was the warmest thing I knew — a promise that someone was still awake, still creating something beautiful. </p> <p> I never saw what he worked on — sketches, maybe, or letters he’d never send — but that light became my lullaby. Then one evening, it didn’t come on. I waited. And waited. The house grew colder with each hour. The next morning, I learned that he was gone. </p> <p> Years later, I became an architect. I built homes full of light — narrow hallways, wooden doors, and small spaces where the glow could fall just so. Every project had the same quiet secret: one lamp, placed low enough that its shine brushed the floorboards, like memory made visible. </p> <p> Even now, some nights, I leave the lamp on when I go to bed. And I imagine a small child somewhere — watching the light under the door, feeling safe for reasons they don’t yet understand. </p> <p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Light Under the Door* captures how the smallest details of love — a glow, a sound, a scent — can outlive everything else. It reminds us that memory isn’t always loud or grand; sometimes it’s just the quiet warmth that guides us home, long after the door has closed. 🌙✨ </p>
