      <p>
        Lunchtime was sacred. I had built the perfect sandwich—  
        layers of turkey, crisp lettuce, and just enough mustard.  
        I placed it on the table, turned for a drink of water,  
        and when I came back… it was gone.  
      </p>

      <p>
        In its place sat Mr. Whiskers, the neighborhood stray cat,  
        licking his paws with the confidence of a king.  
        I blinked. He blinked back.  
        It was less of a theft and more of a royal decree.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I tried bargaining. “Come on, buddy, half for me, half for you.”  
        He yawned. Then, to rub salt in the wound,  
        he dragged the sandwich under the porch and disappeared.  
      </p>

      <p>
        For days, I thought I’d never forgive him.  
        But the next afternoon, he returned—  
        not with my sandwich, but with a dead leaf placed neatly at my doorstep.  
        A peace offering, perhaps?  
      </p>

      <p>
        From then on, I made two sandwiches:  
        one for me, one for Mr. Whiskers.  
        Peace was restored.
