        It all started with a misunderstanding. “We’re just borrowing it,” Tyler said, gesturing to the small fishing boat 
        tied up at the dock. “Nobody’s here, and we’ll be back in an hour.”  
        Famous last words.

        Five minutes later, we were motoring into open water, laughing like we were in some low-budget action movie. 
        The wind whipped through my hair, and the smell of saltwater filled the air. For a moment, it felt like freedom—
        until the boat made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a cough.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do boats cough?” I yelled over the engine.  
        “Not when they’re healthy!” Tyler shouted back, slamming random buttons like a kid playing a video game.  
        That’s when I noticed the name painted on the side: *Maggie’s Pride*.  
        “Tyler… this isn’t a rental boat.”  
        His face went pale.

        Ten minutes later, we were dead in the water. Literally. No engine, no paddles, no clue how to get back.  
        The sky was turning gray, and my phone had no signal. Tyler tried to lighten the mood:  
        “On the bright side, we’ve always wanted to go on an adventure.”  
        “Yeah,” I said, “just didn’t think we’d star in a crime documentary.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, a fisherman spotted us and towed us back to the dock. We rehearsed our “innocent” story:  
        *We thought it was a rental. Honest mistake.*  
        The fisherman raised an eyebrow, but to our relief, he just laughed.  
        “Maggie’s my sister’s boat. She’s in Spain. You’re lucky I’m the one who found you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        We returned to shore sunburned, embarrassed, and laughing so hard it hurt.  
        The next day, Tyler sent me a text:  
        *Same time next weekend?*  
        I didn’t answer. But I did start Googling “boat safety courses.”
