     <p> It started as a simple fascination. <br><br> The mirror was tall, ornate, framed with black oak and golden vines curling toward one another like frozen fire. The seller said it had belonged to a 19th-century portrait artist who’d painted faces “too perfectly.” <br> Lena laughed at that. She was a photographer, not a believer in haunted things. But something about the mirror’s depth — the way it seemed to drink light — drew her in. </p> <p> For the first few weeks, everything was fine. It reflected her living room, her plants, the way morning sun slid across her face. But then, one evening, she noticed something strange — her reflection blinked a moment too late. <br> She froze. <br> Then it blinked again — perfectly in sync — and she shook her head, laughing nervously. “I’m just tired,” she whispered. </p> <p> The next night, her reflection smiled before she did. </p> <p> She stopped using the mirror after that. She covered it with a white sheet, but at night she could still feel it — as if someone was watching from behind the fabric, breathing softly. <br><br> One morning, she woke up and the sheet was gone. </p> <p> The mirror stood bare again, gleaming faintly in the half-light. But when she looked into it… she wasn’t there. <br> Her apartment was reflected perfectly — furniture, curtains, even the flicker of the lamp — but not her. </p> <p> Panic clawed up her throat. She touched her face, her arms — she was solid. Real. But the mirror denied her existence. <br> Then, as she leaned closer, she saw movement behind the glass. <br> A shadow, the shape of her body, turning its head toward her. </p> <p> She stumbled backward, knocking over a chair. <br> The reflection — her reflection — began to move closer to the glass, its expression calm, eyes hollow. <br><br> And then it smiled. </p> <p> That night, Lena called her friend Eva. “Come over,” she said, her voice trembling. “Bring salt, and maybe… I don’t know, something holy.” <br> Eva arrived within the hour. But when she entered, she found the mirror already cracked, spiderwebs of silver cutting through the glass. <br><br> And behind it — faintly — a woman’s hand pressed against the inside, fingers leaving no prints. </p> <p> Lena was nowhere in the apartment. <br> The police found no sign of struggle, only her camera on the floor. The last photo she’d taken was of her own reflection — only it wasn’t hers. <br><br> The woman in the picture looked like Lena… but her eyes were older, deeper, almost relieved. </p> <p> The mirror was later sold again, quietly, to a collector. <br> He swore it was ordinary — except that sometimes, when he walked by, he could see a second figure in the reflection behind him, watching, waiting. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Mirror That Never Reflected* explores the idea that our reflections aren’t always loyal — that somewhere beyond the glass, something observes us in silence, waiting for the moment we forget which side we truly belong to. <br> It’s not the mirror that lies — it’s the image that learns to live without us. 🪞🖤 </p>
