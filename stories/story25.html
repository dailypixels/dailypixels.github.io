      <p>
        The lake was still that evening, as if holding its breath for what was about to happen.  
        Emma stood at the dock with a paper lantern in her hands, its thin frame trembling in the warm summer breeze.  
        All around her, families and strangers gathered quietly, each holding their own little beacon of light. 
        The air smelled of grass, candle wax, and the faint sweetness of honeysuckle drifting from the trees.
      </p>

      <p>
        It had been a year since she lost her brother. The grief had settled into her like an unwelcome guest, 
        always there, always heavy. When her neighbor invited her to the annual lantern festival, she almost said no.  
        But now, standing at the edge of the dock, she was glad she came.
      </p>

      <p>
        A soft hum of conversation filled the evening. The lanterns were more than decorations;  
        each one carried a message, a prayer, a name whispered by trembling lips.  
        Emma crouched down, shielding her lantern as she lit the candle inside. The glow bloomed gently,  
        illuminating her face and the neat handwriting scrawled on its paper walls:  
        *“For Liam. Always with me.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ready?” a volunteer asked softly, smiling as they gestured to the lake.  
        Emma nodded. She knelt at the edge of the dock and carefully set her lantern onto the water.  
        It wobbled for a moment, then drifted away, joining a growing constellation of lights floating across the lake.  
        The reflection shimmered, doubling the stars in the sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        She didn’t expect to cry. She thought she’d used up all her tears months ago,  
        but watching that little lantern bob gently in the dark water cracked something open.  
        Yet, for the first time, her tears felt lighter, as if grief was making space for something new.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Around her, more lanterns were released. The lake glowed golden, a sea of moving stars.  
        Children laughed softly, couples held hands, and strangers stood shoulder-to-shoulder in reverent silence.  
        Emma felt her breath slow, her heart calm. Liam was gone, yes. But in this moment,  
        surrounded by warmth and light, she felt his presence—not as pain, but as love.  
      </p>

      <p>
        She whispered a thank you into the night.  
        The lantern drifted farther away, becoming part of the glowing tapestry.  
        And for the first time in a long time, Emma allowed herself to imagine tomorrow—not as something to survive,  
        but something she could look forward to.
