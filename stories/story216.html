      <p>It had been seven years since Daniel Holloway last saw the sun rise from the cliffs of Calden Ridge. Back then, he’d stood there with his wife, laughing as the wind whipped their hair and the valley below filled with gold. Now he stood alone, his hands trembling around a walking stick, his heart heavy with silence.</p>

<p>The doctors said he’d walk again, but pain had a way of making promises sound like lies. His accident — a fall during a rescue climb — had broken more than bones. It had broken his will. He’d spent years in therapy, relearning how to move, to hope, to live. But something inside him refused to heal.</p>

<p>Until one letter arrived. From his old friend, Morgan — the mountain ranger who had once saved his life.</p>

<p><em>“Meet me at dawn on the old bridge,”</em> it read. <em>“It’s time you crossed again.”</em></p>

<p>Daniel almost threw it away. The bridge he mentioned — the Bridge of Dawn — hung across a chasm two thousand feet deep. Rotted planks, fraying ropes, the same bridge Daniel had fallen from that night years ago.</p>

<p>But something about the words <em>‘crossed again’</em> haunted him. So, before sunrise, Daniel began the slow climb up the ridge. His cane clicked against the rocks. Each step burned, but he didn’t stop. Not this time.</p>

<p>When he reached the ridge, the world was still dark blue. Mist coiled in the valley like sleeping clouds. The bridge stretched before him — frail, trembling in the wind. But on the other side, the horizon blushed with light.</p>

<p>“Morgan?” he called. No answer. Only the creak of rope, the whisper of dawn.</p>

<p>He hesitated at the first plank. It bowed beneath his weight. He closed his eyes, remembering the snap of rope, the scream of falling, the years of waking up to the same nightmare.</p>

<p>“You’re not falling,” he whispered to himself. “You’re crossing.”</p>

<p>Step by step, he moved. The wood groaned, wind howled through the chasm. Halfway across, a plank broke beneath his foot, and he froze. His cane slipped from his hand and disappeared into the mist below. His heart hammered — this was it, the edge of his courage.</p>

<p>Then he heard a voice. Faint, carried by wind — Morgan’s voice, echoing from somewhere unseen:</p>

<p><em>“You don’t need to hold the bridge, Daniel. You need to trust it.”</em></p>

<p>He laughed through tears. “Trust it,” he repeated. His hands loosened. He stepped forward again — slower, but steady. When he reached the last plank, the first rays of sunlight spilled over the cliffs, painting the world gold once more.</p>

<p>And on the far side of the bridge, a single note lay pinned to a stone with a small metal carabiner. Daniel picked it up.</p>

<p><em>“You’ve already crossed once before, my friend — the hard way. This time, you crossed for yourself.”</em></p>

<p>He looked up, and for the first time in years, smiled. The sun rose higher, burning the mist away, revealing the valley in all its color. He sat there, breathing it in, feeling every ray, every heartbeat.</p>

<p>That day, Daniel didn’t just conquer fear. He rebuilt his faith — not in bridges or ropes, but in his own strength.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Bridge of Dawn</em> is a story about courage after loss — how healing is not about forgetting pain but walking through it. Every broken plank we cross becomes proof that faith, even when fragile, can carry us to light. 🌅✨</p>
