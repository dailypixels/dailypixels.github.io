        Every morning before dawn, the bakery’s door opened to a hush of flour and the soft hiss of ovens. Mr. Iqbal had baked for forty years; his hands smelled of yeast and salt and the careful patience of someone who'd learned to measure life in rises and falls.

        His noon hour was a ritual. Housewives from the lane came for flatbread, students collected sweet buns, and an elderly teacher ordered a slice of sponge cake — always to be eaten slowly on the bench outside, where stories were traded with every bite. Today, a courier boy stood shivering at the counter with a note: the hospital needed bread for a night shift. Iqbal smiled and wrapped an extra dozen.
      </p>

      <p>
        He watched the town in the shop’s reflection: the barber sweeping, the grocer stacking oranges, a child practicing a small poem to recite at school. The bakery was not merely a place of bread, he thought; it was an archive of small mercy. A woman who had lost much found comfort in buying a single bun; a man in debt returned a loaf with gratitude painted on his face.
      </p>

        At noon, the bell chimed and the line shortened. Iqbal handed a free roll to a young father who admitted he couldn't pay for milk that week. The father’s eyes filled; he left holding the bread like a promise. Iqbal felt warmth beyond ovens — a kind of warmth that rose when you knew the people outside the shop would survive another day.
      </p>

      <p>
        That evening, as the ovens cooled, Iqbal closed the shutters and wrote in a small notebook: *“Baked today: 120 loaves. Given away: 4. Smiles collected: many.”* He put the book on a high shelf. He did not count the value of kindness in numbers; he counted it in return: the neighbor who fixed his roof, the girl who brought wildflowers, the boy who promised to sweep the doorstep.
      </p>

      <p>
        The town slept under a blanket of quiet contentment. The baker’s noon had, once again, fulfilled its simple promise: bread for bodies, presence for hearts.
