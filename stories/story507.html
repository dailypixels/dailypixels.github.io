    <main class="story-content">
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> People in your village call you “the book mother.” How did this start?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> I grew up where books were treasures. When I saw children repeating the same stories without ever touching a book, I decided to bring one here, then another, and another. Now we have shelves full of them.</p>

      <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you sustain the library?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> We began with donations. Then people started leaving behind a book whenever they borrowed one. It became a cycle of giving. Some even donate their school prizes here. The library belongs to everyone now.</p>

      <p><strong>Q:</strong> What has been the biggest change?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Confidence. Children read aloud, argue over characters, dream bigger. A boy once told me he wanted to be an astronaut because he read about stars here. That is enough for me.</p>

      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you see this library as your life’s work?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> No, it is our collective work. I only planted the seed. The village watered it with love. Together, we built something that will outlive us.</p>
