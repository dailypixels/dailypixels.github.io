        The streetlights on Ashwood Street flickered like nervous eyes, casting fractured halos onto wet pavement. 
        It was just after midnight when I got the call—a neighbor swore she’d seen a figure slip between buildings 
        and vanish near the alley that locals avoided after dark.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her name was Mara Ellis. Twenty-eight. She’d lived here her whole life, knew every corner of this neighborhood. 
        And yet, two days ago, she was gone without a trace. Her apartment was undisturbed. Her car still parked. 
        The only thing missing was her red umbrella, the one she always carried even on sunny days.
      </p>

      <p>
        I followed the alley where the neighbor swore she saw someone. The smell of rain and gasoline hung thick in the air. 
        The alley opened to a dead-end courtyard, its bricks slick and gleaming under the glow of a lone neon sign. 
        That’s when I noticed the umbrella, folded neatly against the wall, perfectly dry despite the storm.
      </p>

      <p>
        A chill ran through me. Someone had left it there intentionally. Someone wanted it found.
      </p>

      <p>
        I crouched to pick it up, and that’s when I saw it: a message etched into the wet pavement in chalk.  
        *“You’re looking in the wrong place.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        The rain began to fall harder, washing the letters away. I stood there, holding the umbrella, 
        knowing that whoever left the message was still out there—watching, waiting. 
        Ashwood Street had never felt so quiet, so alive, so dangerous.
