      <p> The year was 1086 BCE. The once-golden city of *Waset* — now fading under the rule of Pharaoh Akenrames II — stood at the edge of ruin. The Nile’s waters had receded, harvests failed, and the people whispered that the gods had turned their faces away. But inside the palace walls, music still lived — and with it, hope. </p> <p> <em>Nerai</em> was the youngest musician in the royal court, known for her reed flute that could make even the priests pause their chants. Her melodies were said to call the falcons from the cliffs, to make the air shimmer with light. But Nerai played under watchful eyes — for Pharaoh Akenrames had forbidden songs of freedom after a failed rebellion. Only hymns of devotion were allowed, every note a chain disguised as praise. </p> <p> One evening, while repairing her instrument, Nerai discovered an old scroll hidden within its hollow shaft. It contained the lyrics of a forbidden hymn — *The Song of the Falcon*, written generations ago by a rebel poet who believed that music carried the soul of truth. Legend said whoever played the song would awaken the spirit of Horus, god of kingship and sky, to judge the ruler’s heart. </p> <p> That night, as the moon rose above the palace, Nerai climbed the western tower overlooking the sleeping city. She held her flute to her lips and began to play. The melody was soft at first, trembling like the wind over the desert. Then it rose, fierce and alive — a cry of wings, a call to the heavens. </p> <p> Below, torches flared. Guards shouted. But before they reached her, a great shadow crossed the moon — a falcon, its feathers shining gold. The bird circled once, then vanished into the darkness. The next morning, the Pharaoh’s golden mask cracked during the dawn ceremony, and a sandstorm swept through the palace, scattering relics and idols alike. </p> <p> When the storm cleared, the throne was empty. The people said the gods had carried Akenrames away. Nerai was arrested, but when the guards entered her chamber, they found only her flute lying on the floor, still warm — as if it had just been played. </p> <p> Years later, travelers along the Nile spoke of a wandering musician whose songs called falcons to perch on her shoulders. Her music carried across the river like whispers of freedom, and wherever it was heard, the people lifted their heads a little higher. They called her *The Voice of the Sky.* </p> <p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Song of the Falcon* is a story about courage in silence — the defiance that lives in art when words are forbidden. It reminds us that even in times of oppression, truth finds its voice. Songs may fade, rulers may fall, but the melody of freedom always returns on the wind. 🪶🌅 </p>
