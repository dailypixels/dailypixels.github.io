    <main class="story-content">
      <p>The rain had been falling for three days when Thomas Everett found the letter.</p>

<p>It was tucked beneath his front door, soaked at the edges, the ink running like tears. The handwriting was unmistakable — neat, looping, the kind he hadn’t seen in fifteen years. For a long time, he simply stared at it, his hands trembling above the paper. Then, slowly, he tore it open.</p>

<p><em>Dear Dad,</em><br>
<em>I’m not sure you’ll even read this, but I needed to try. I used to think you left because of me. I don’t know if that’s true anymore. I’m getting married next month — his name’s David — and I can’t walk down that aisle without knowing if you’re still alive. If you are, I want you to come. No one else needs to know. Just you and me.</em><br>
<em>— Emily</em></p>

<p>Thomas read the words again and again until the candle beside him burned out. The sound of rain filled the empty house, dripping through the holes in the roof, echoing off the walls he’d never repaired. It had been fifteen years since he’d seen her — the day he left after the argument with her mother, slamming the door so hard it broke the frame. He told himself he’d come back once things calmed down. He never did.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next morning, Thomas took the old truck out of the shed. It coughed like a dying animal, but he coaxed it to life. He drove past the rusted mills and dead fields, through the town he once called home. Every street carried a memory: Emily’s bicycle on the corner, her laughter on summer mornings, the sound of her small feet running across the porch.</p>

<p>When he reached her address — written on the back of the letter — his heart thudded against his ribs. The house was white, with ivy crawling up the fence. Through the window, he saw her — older, with the same eyes as her mother’s. She was holding a child on her hip, smiling down at someone unseen.</p>

<p>He couldn’t move. Fifteen years of silence had turned into a wall he wasn’t sure how to climb.</p>

<hr>

<p>He finally knocked. The door opened a moment later, and Emily froze. The child stopped babbling. Time itself seemed to stop.</p>

<p>“Dad?” she whispered.</p>

<p>He nodded, unable to speak.</p>

<p>She stared for a long time, tears filling her eyes. “You got my letter.”</p>

<p>“I did.” His voice cracked. “Every word.”</p>

<p>“Why now?”</p>

<p>Thomas swallowed hard. “Because it took me fifteen years to find the courage to deserve a second chance.”</p>

<p>Emily looked at him, then at the child in her arms. “This is Lily,” she said softly. “Your granddaughter.”</p>

<p>Thomas reached out, his hand trembling. The little girl smiled, grabbing his finger with her tiny hand. In that single moment, something inside him broke — and something else healed.</p>

<hr>

<p>They sat in the kitchen for hours. He told her everything: the fear, the shame, the way he’d watched her grow from afar through newspaper clippings her mother wrote for. She listened without interrupting. When he finished, she said quietly, “I hated you for a long time. But I never stopped hoping you’d come back.”</p>

<p>He nodded, tears blurring his vision. “I never stopped wanting to.”</p>

<p>As the night deepened, she handed him another envelope — smaller, cleaner, this one with her handwriting but fresh ink.</p>

<p>“It’s your invitation,” she said. “For real this time.”</p>

<p>Thomas took it, his chest aching. “You still want me there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “But not as the man who left. As the man who came home.”</p>

<hr>

<p>A week later, Thomas stood at the back of the small church. When the doors opened and Emily walked down the aisle, she paused midway to look at him. She smiled — not the smile of a daughter forgiving a father, but of two people finally finding peace.</p>

<p>For the first time in fifteen years, Thomas Everett felt the weight lift from his heart. The rain outside had stopped.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Letter</em> is a story of redemption and courage — a reminder that time can wound, but it can also heal. Sometimes, forgiveness isn’t a single moment; it’s a bridge built one word, one step, one return at a time. 💌🌧️</p>
