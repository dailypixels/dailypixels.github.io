     <p><strong>Part I: The Outage Begins</strong></p>

<p>On a quiet street in Lahore’s Model Town, the unthinkable happened one Tuesday morning — the Wi-Fi went down.</p>

<p>For retired postmaster <strong>Mr. Jalal</strong>, this was a crisis. His morning routine of YouTube cricket highlights and WhatsApp jokes came to a sudden, tragic halt. He rebooted the router — twice. He even yelled at it, which usually worked with his TV. But nothing.</p>

<p>Across the street, <strong>Mr. Baig</strong>, a retired math teacher, was having the same problem. Instead of panicking, he did what any logical man would: he climbed his roof with binoculars to see if Jalal’s Wi-Fi light was blinking. “Sabotage,” he muttered when he saw Jalal fiddling with cables.</p>

<p>By noon, both men were convinced the other had hacked their internet. Thus began what the local kids would later call: <em>The Great Wi-Fi War.</em></p>

<p><strong>Part II: The Escalation</strong></p>

<p>Jalal renamed his new hotspot “<em>BaigIsATraitor_2.4GHz</em>.” Within hours, Baig responded with “<em>OldManNextDoorHasNoSignal</em>.”</p>

<p>The petty revenge escalated quickly. Jalal built a cardboard “signal booster” shaped like a satellite dish. Baig installed a motion sensor that played the Nokia ringtone every time Jalal stepped near his gate.</p>

<p>The neighborhood WhatsApp group exploded with gossip. Someone even made a meme of the two men photoshopped into a wrestling ring, with the caption “<em>Streaming Soon: Wi-Fi Wars – Episode II</em>.”</p>

<p><strong>Part III: The Unexpected Alliance</strong></p>

<p>Three days later, a technician finally arrived. “Sir,” he said politely after inspecting both routers, “your problem isn’t each other. It’s the main fiber line — a cat chewed it.”</p>

<p>There was silence. Both men stared at him. Then, slowly, Mr. Jalal turned toward Baig and said, “So... you didn’t hack me?”</p>

<p>Baig sighed. “No. But I might have... borrowed your signal once. During PSL.”</p>

<p>They burst out laughing for the first time in years. The technician left confused, but the men stayed, sitting on the porch, sharing cold drinks and stories from their youth — discovering they had far more in common than their Wi-Fi drama suggested.</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Reunion</strong></p>

<p>A week later, their routers were finally fixed. But something had changed. Instead of staying indoors, they met daily at the park. Together they started teaching local kids basic computer skills — and soon became minor celebrities when a video of their “Wi-Fi Peace Treaty” went viral.</p>

<p>In the end, Jalal renamed his network “<em>BaigAndJalal_United</em>,” and Baig changed his password to “<em>Friendship2025</em>.”</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Great Wi-Fi War</em> reminds us that sometimes, life’s funniest conflicts start with small misunderstandings. Humor has the power to bridge even the pettiest divides. And while Wi-Fi connects devices, it’s laughter that reconnects people. 📶😂</p>
