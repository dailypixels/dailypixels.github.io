      <p>
        He sits with a pencil and patience,  
        tracing the quiet geography of ordinary days.  
        Lines for alleyways where children trade secrets,  
        Dots for windows where light lingers beyond dusk.
      </p>

      <p>
        His maps are not of mountains alone —  
        They hold the hidden bends of hearts,  
        Houses stitched with laughter and argument,  
        Paths softened by footsteps of those who return.
      </p>

      <p>
        For every road that stretches outward,  
        he draws a tender return,  
        a route that leads not elsewhere but back —  
        to table, to porch, to a kettle left warm.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are maps that teach direction by memory,  
        cartography by kindness;  
        for those who read them know the world better:  
        not as conquest but as place to be loved.
      </p>
