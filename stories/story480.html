      <p>
        In a forgotten corner of Prague, a clock shop stayed open past midnight. Every clock inside ticked in perfect harmony—except one. A small brass pocket watch refused to keep time, its hands always pointing to midnight.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Lukas, the young apprentice, asked the old clockmaker why he kept it. The old man’s eyes glimmered. “That watch doesn’t tell time—it keeps a memory. Midnight, the night my brother vanished. As long as it ticks, I know the truth is still alive.”  
      </p>
      <p>
        Lukas leaned closer. The watch ticked faintly, but not forward—backward.  
      </p>
      <p>
        That night, Lukas dreamt of winding streets, shadows in doorways, and a voice whispering: “Find me before the last tick.”  
      </p>
      <p>
        When he woke, the watch was gone from the shelf. Only the sound of backward ticking remained, echoing through the dark shop.
