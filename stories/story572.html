      <p>
        Rain fell in sheets, turning the street into a mirror.
From her small apartment, Mira watched the house opposite — its windows dark, roof bowed with age.
All except one.
The attic window.
      </p>

      <p>
        It always glowed softly after midnight — pale blue, like a heartbeat trying to remember itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had moved to the city for quiet, but quiet had teeth. It left her with the kind of silence that hummed. Her husband, Arman, had died two winters ago. Some nights she still heard his voice — in the kettle’s whistle, in the creak of the hallway floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, she couldn’t stand it anymore. She crossed the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        The old house greeted her with dust and rot. The light from the attic pulsed faintly. She climbed the stairs, each step protesting. When she reached the door, she hesitated — then pushed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, the room was empty… except for a single framed photograph.
Her and Arman. Smiling. From a trip she had long forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>
        And behind her reflection in the glass — a shadow moved.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why did you leave the window open?” a voice whispered.
      </p>

      <p>
        She spun, heart hammering — but there was no one. Only the curtain swaying, and that cold blue light bleeding from the photo frame.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning, the house across the street was gone.
A vacant lot stood where it once had been.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when Mira looked at her own reflection that night, the attic window appeared behind her — glowing softly, waiting.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Meaning / Reflection:
      </h2>

      <p>
        Grief does not haunt us to scare — it lingers to be seen.
Sometimes, the past doesn’t want to be remembered; it only wants to know we haven’t forgotten.
