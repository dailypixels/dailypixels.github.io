        Every year, the small village of Marala came alive with the Paper Lantern Festival. Streets smelled of incense, laughter bounced between lantern-lit houses, and children ran with glowing paper cranes in hand. For most, it was a spectacle; for Leena, a young teacher who had faced countless rejections in her career, it was a symbol of hope.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Leena had always believed in the magic of small gestures. Each lantern she folded, each wish she whispered into its flame, was a promise to herself to keep going despite failures. Her heart carried both longing and fear—the fear that her efforts might never matter.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The festival night arrived. Hundreds of lanterns hovered like floating stars, filling the dark sky with dreams. Leena’s lantern rose slowly, twisting in the wind, and then soared higher than she expected. In that instant, she felt the burdens she had carried for years lighten. She realized that hope, once released, can touch places unseen.  
      </p>

        Villagers cheered and strangers exchanged smiles. Some lanterns landed far away, touching distant towns and rivers. The invisible connections forged that night reminded everyone that small acts—folded with love and intention—could ripple into something magnificent.
