  <hr>

<p>Driftwood Bay was the kind of place where secrets lived in the wind. The sea murmured them, the gulls screamed them, and the old lighthouse — tall, white, and worn by years of storms — held them.</p>
<p>Everyone knew the stories.
No one knew the truth.</p> 
<p>For decades, people whispered about the Lantern Keeper — a figure who appeared inside the lighthouse only when someone in the town was drifting off their path. Not drowning-in-the-ocean lost… but lost-in-the-heart lost. He never spoke to everyone, only to the one person who needed him most at the time.</p> 
<p>Some said he was a ghost.
Some said he was a retired sailor.
Others claimed he was time itself, wearing an old coat and smelling like salt.</p>   
<p>Then one night, he appeared for Arslan.</p> 
<hr>
<h3>The Restlessness</h3>
<p>Arslan had grown up in Driftwood Bay with one dream: to leave. His father and grandfather had been fishermen, but he wanted a life that did not smell like brine and diesel. He wanted to build things — boats, furniture, maybe even houses someday. But everyone told him:</p> 
<p>“Fishermen don’t become builders.”
“Dreams don’t feed families.”
“You belong to the sea.”</p>
<p>It gnawed at him until frustration became a second heartbeat.</p>
<p>One evening, after a bad argument with his father about taking over the fishing boat, Arslan stormed out into the cold coastal wind. The cliffs glowed under moonlight, and far above them, the lighthouse flickered — something it hadn't done in months.</p> 
<p>People said it only lit up when someone needed guidance.</p> 
<p>Arslan scoffed. “Well, if it’s calling me, it better have something good to say.”</p>   
<p>He climbed the winding trail toward the lighthouse.</p> 
<hr>
<h3>The Lighthouse</h3>
<p>The big wooden door wasn’t locked — as if expecting him.</p> 
<p>Inside, the spiral staircase creaked under his weight. The lantern room at the top was warm, glowing gold like a tiny sun. And standing beside the old Fresnel lens was a man in a long weathered coat.</p> 
<p>White beard.
Eyes calm as still water.
Face both old and ageless at once.</p>
<p>“You’re late,” the man said gently, as though he had known Arslan all his life.</p> 
<p>Arslan froze. “Who… who are you?”</p> 
<p>“Someone who keeps people from drifting too far,” the Lantern Keeper replied, adjusting the lamp. “Why are your thoughts louder than the sea tonight?”</p>   
<p>Arslan hesitated. Then, without warning, everything spilled out — how trapped he felt, how everyone expected him to choose the same life as his ancestors, how guilty he felt for wanting something different, and how afraid he was of disappointing his father.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do,” Arslan said finally. “Every choice feels wrong.”</p> 
<p>The Lantern Keeper walked to the big window overlooking the ocean. “Do you see that buoy out there?” he asked.</p>
<p>A tiny red buoy bobbed far below in the black waves.</p>
<p>“It moves with the water,” the Keeper continued, “but it is anchored. That’s why it doesn’t get lost.”</p> 
<p>Arslan frowned. “What does that have to do with me?”</p> 
<p>“You think your choices are chains,” the keeper said. “But they are anchors. You can choose where your rope goes. Your past is not your prison.”</p>   
<p>He handed Arslan an old carpenter’s chisel, polished but used.</p> 
<p>“Build one thing,” the Keeper said. “Just one. If it feels wrong, stop. If it feels right… you already know the path.”</p> 
<p>Arslan looked down at the tool, then back up — but the Lantern Keeper was gone.</p>
<p>The lantern still burned.
The room was still warm.
But the Keeper had vanished like mist.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Next Morning</h3>
<p>Arslan spent the next day shaping a piece of driftwood into a small boat model. Not perfect — uneven edges, lopsided hull — but when he finished, something clicked inside him.</p> 
<p>It wasn’t just joy.
It was recognition.</p> 
<p>“This is what I want,” he whispered.</p>   
<p>He showed the carving to his father that evening. Not to argue — just to share.</p> 
<p>His father stared at it for a long moment. Then he sighed and placed a heavy hand on Arslan’s shoulder.</p> 
<p>“You were never meant to be a fisherman,” he said quietly. “I just didn’t want you to leave me behind.”</p>
<p>Arslan hugged him, relief flooding both of them.</p>
<p>Within a year, Arslan became the most skilled woodworker in Driftwood Bay. Tourists bought his carvings. Locals paid him to repair their boats. And every night when he walked home, he glanced up at the lighthouse.</p> 
<p>Sometimes the lantern glowed.
Sometimes it didn’t.</p> 
<p>But he always felt grateful that on the night he was truly lost… it was shining for him.</p>   

<hr>
<h3>🌅 Meaning / Reflection</h3>

<p>This story is a reminder that <strong>your past doesn’t have to define your future</strong>. Tradition is beautiful, but it should never become a cage. Everyone has an inner compass — sometimes dusty, sometimes buried under expectations — but still there.</p>
<p>You are allowed to choose differently.
You are allowed to want more.
You are allowed to rewrite the path.</p> 
<p>And when you’re lost, guidance often appears in unexpected forms — a person, a moment, a conversation, or even a quiet thought you finally decided to listen to.</p> 
<p>Find your anchor.
Choose your direction.
And let your own lantern guide you home.</p>
