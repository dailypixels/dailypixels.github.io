      <p>
        Mia and Harper had been inseparable since middle school.  
        Their bond was a quiet understanding, a shared laughter  
        that carried them through awkward teenage years.  
        Life, however, had a way of scattering people like leaves in the wind.
      </p>

      <p>
        College took Mia across the country,  
        and Harper stayed behind, building a life in their hometown.  
        Texts and calls became rare, replaced by the hum of new routines.  
        But both carried a secret hope that their paths would cross again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ten years later, a reunion was arranged—spontaneous, almost reckless.  
        They met at the same hill where they had spent countless evenings  
        watching the sun dip behind the horizon, dreaming of the future.  
        Time melted away; the familiar warmth returned instantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        As they hiked together, sharing stories of triumphs and failures,  
        Mia realized that the distance hadn’t weakened their bond—it had strengthened it.  
        Harper smiled knowingly. “Some friendships,” she said,  
        “aren’t measured by time or proximity. They are measured by trust, love, and resilience.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The sun rose, painting the valley in gold and pink.  
        They laughed, cried, and promised to never let the world pull them apart again.  
        Beyond the horizon, they could see endless possibilities,  
        knowing that together, they could face whatever came next.
