    <main class="story-content">
      <p>The year was 1491, and the kingdom of Granada stood on the edge of ruin. The banners of Castile flew closer every day, and the once-proud palaces of Alhambra whispered with fear. Among the servants and soldiers lived a young falconer named Zayd ibn Tariq — a boy of no noble blood, but of steady hand and unshakable heart.</p>

<p>Every morning, he would climb the crimson towers before dawn to train his falcon, Sirocco. Together they soared over the misted orchards and marble courtyards, their shadows gliding across the sleeping city. The bird was swift and fierce, a gift from the Sultan himself, and Zayd treated it not as a beast, but as a brother.</p>

<p>One evening, as the palace burned with the glow of sunset, the Sultan summoned him in secret. The old ruler’s eyes were weary, his beard silver like moonlight.</p>

<p>“Zayd,” he said softly, “our city will fall before winter. But there is something that must not fall with it.”</p>

<p>He drew from his robe a small, sealed cylinder of bronze. “Inside lies the map to the last refuge of our people — the Library of Zahra. It holds the writings of our ancestors, the wisdom of centuries. You must deliver it to the scholars of Fez. If the Christians find it, our light will vanish forever.”</p>

<p>Zayd bowed low, heart pounding. “I will guard it with my life.”</p>

<p>Before dawn, disguised as a trader, he slipped from the city gates. The roads to Fez were treacherous — filled with patrols, thieves, and worse, those who would sell anything for gold. Sirocco flew ahead as his eyes and protector. For days they crossed mountains and rivers, their food scarce, their sleep restless.</p>

<p>But on the seventh night, near the river Genil, he was ambushed. A band of soldiers surrounded him, torches blazing. “Halt!” their captain shouted. “You carry the Sultan’s secret!”</p>

<p>Zayd turned to run, but an arrow struck the ground beside him. He loosed Sirocco with a sharp cry. The falcon rose like a streak of gold and struck the captain’s face, blinding him. In the chaos, Zayd leapt into the river’s current. The bronze cylinder slipped from his belt, sinking into the dark.</p>

<p>He dove after it, lungs burning, fingers brushing the cold metal. But the current was too strong. When he surfaced, gasping, he was alone. The soldiers searched the banks but found only his cloak. They left, certain he had drowned.</p>

<p>By morning, Zayd crawled from the reeds, battered but alive. His falcon perched nearby, soaked and shivering — and in its claws, gleamed the bronze cylinder.</p>

<p>“You saved it,” he whispered, tears mixing with river water. “You saved our light.”</p>

<p>Weeks later, he reached Fez under moonlight. The scholars took the map and hid it deep within their archives, far from kings and conquerors. Zayd never returned to Granada, but he lived to hear that his home had fallen — and yet, the knowledge of his people endured.</p>

<p>When he died, Sirocco was seen circling above his grave three times before flying toward the horizon, never to be seen again. Some say the falcon still guards the lost library, waiting for a world wise enough to open its doors once more.</p>
