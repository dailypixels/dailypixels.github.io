      <p>
        Grocery shopping should be simple. It never is.  
        I only needed milk and bread, but somehow, I ended up navigating  
        a full-on obstacle course of squeaky carts, toddlers on sugar highs,  
        and a woman aggressively sampling every free cheese cube in sight.
      </p>

      <p>
        My first mistake was grabbing the wobbly cart.  
        You know the one—the wheel that squeaks like a sad trumpet  
        every time you turn. By aisle three, everyone knew I had arrived.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I got trapped behind a slow-moving “cart convoy”:  
        three friends blocking the entire aisle while discussing  
        their cousin’s wedding drama in excruciating detail.  
        I tried to pass. The squeaky wheel betrayed me. We locked eyes. I retreated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, at checkout, I realized I’d forgotten the bread.  
        I dashed back, dodging a rogue toddler on a mini-cart,  
        slid around a corner, and nearly collided with a towering display  
        of cereal boxes. The squeaky wheel screamed. The boxes wobbled.  
        A heroic bystander caught them. I’m not sure who was more traumatized.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time I made it to the car, I was sweaty,  
        exhausted, and… breadless.  
        I drove home with only milk, a bruised ego,  
        and a vow to shop online next time.
