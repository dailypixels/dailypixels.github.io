     <p> It had been twelve years since I last walked down Mirabel Street — the place where we first met, where every window once framed laughter, and where every corner still whispered your name. <br><br> The rain had just started when I got off the bus. The same soft drizzle you loved. You’d always stop, tilt your head to the sky, and say, “Rain is the world’s way of remembering.” </p> <p> I used to write those words down in the margins of my notebooks — little reminders that you understood things I could never explain. But after you were gone, the rain stopped meaning anything. For years, I closed the curtains when storms came. I couldn’t bear the sound of remembering. </p> <p> Today, though, something made me return. Maybe it was the silence of my apartment, or the way the light fell across your old photograph. Or maybe it was time finally telling me: *go back, before it’s too late.* <br><br> The street looked smaller, lonelier — like a painting that had been rained on too many times. The bakery had changed hands, the park swings were gone. But the scent of wet earth, that remained. </p> <p> I found the bench where we once shared coffee from a paper cup — your side still faintly carved with your initials. My fingers traced the letters, trembling a little. And then, I heard it. <br> A faint sound. Someone humming. The same tune you used to hum when you painted by the window — slow, hopeful, like the world wasn’t ending but beginning again. </p> <p> Across the street, a young woman was standing beneath an umbrella, looking up at the same row of houses. She couldn’t have been more than twenty-five. She noticed me staring and smiled gently, as if she already knew me. </p> <p> “Beautiful, isn’t it?” she said. “The rain?” I asked. She nodded. “No matter how long it’s gone, it always finds its way back.” <br><br> There was something in her voice — the same tone, the same calm certainty that you used to carry. For a second, it felt like time folded over itself, and I was back there again — you beside me, the rain between us, everything still possible. </p> <p> The girl turned to leave, but then paused. “You dropped this,” she said, handing me a small bookmark that had fallen from my coat pocket. It wasn’t mine. It was old, worn, painted with watercolor raindrops and the words: <br> <em>“The rain remembers everything we forget.”</em> </p> <p> I watched her disappear into the mist. The streetlights flickered, and the drizzle grew steadier — not cold anymore, but alive, gentle, like it wanted to be felt again. <br><br> For the first time in years, I let it. I tilted my face upward, eyes closed, letting the rain run down my cheeks — and it felt like a conversation finally finished, a story completed. </p> <p> When I left Mirabel Street that evening, I carried no souvenirs, no photos — only the warmth of the rain and a quiet, certain peace. Maybe remembering isn’t about holding on — maybe it’s about learning how to let go, softly, without forgetting. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Street of Returning Rain* is a story about **grief, memory, and renewal** — how returning to the places that once broke us can sometimes help us find the pieces we lost. <br><br> It reminds us that love doesn’t truly vanish; it changes form, like rain evaporating into clouds only to fall again — different, yet the same. 🌧️ </p>
