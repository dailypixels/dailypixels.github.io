      <p>The letters began almost by accident. Evelyn had stumbled upon a forgotten mailbox in the coastal town of Marseille, and inside was a single envelope addressed to her, though she had never received it. Its contents were simple: a note from someone named Adrian, full of wonder and warmth, describing the sunrise over the harbor and asking if she had seen the same light.</p>

<p>Curious and amused, Evelyn wrote back, not knowing if anyone would ever read her reply. Weeks passed, and each letter she sent was returned with another. Adrian’s words painted a picture of life across the sea, of a city full of music, markets, and winding streets. Through their letters, they shared hopes, dreams, fears, and laughter. The distance seemed irrelevant; their hearts had found a rhythm that no ocean could drown.</p>

<hr>

<p>Months went by. Every day, Evelyn awoke hoping for a letter, each envelope a lifeline. She could feel Adrian’s presence in the way he described the smell of fresh bread, the cries of street vendors, or the simple joy of watching children play near the fountains. His words were a map to a soul she had not yet met in person, and her replies became as much a part of her as the ocean breeze she loved to feel on her walks.</p>

<p>Then, one morning, a letter arrived with a different tone. Adrian had written that he was returning to Marseille for a brief visit — and he wanted to meet her. Evelyn’s heart raced as she read the words. The ocean that had kept them apart for so long now felt like the final obstacle she had to cross.</p>

<hr>

<p>The day came. Evelyn stood at the edge of the pier, the wind tugging at her coat and hair, scanning every face. Then she saw him — Adrian, taller than she imagined, with eyes that mirrored the deep blue of the Mediterranean. He smiled, and in that instant, every letter, every longing, every quiet moment shared across paper and ink became real.</p>

<p>They walked slowly along the harbor, sharing stories they had only written before, laughing at how words had never truly captured their voices, their laughter, their silences. And yet, every letter had prepared them for this meeting, making the moment both inevitable and magical.</p>

<p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in gold and rose, Adrian took her hand. “I’ve written to you every day, but I think this is the only letter I truly need to send,” he said, leaning closer. “I don’t want to wait for another envelope to reach you.”</p>

<p>Evelyn smiled, feeling the same surge of hope and warmth she had felt with every letter. “Then don’t,” she whispered. “Let’s write our story together, from now on.”</p>
