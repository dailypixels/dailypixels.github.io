      <p>
        After years apart, Claire returned to her hometown, carrying a bundle of letters she had never sent to Liam.  
        Life had pulled them in different directions, yet every word she had written kept the memory of him alive.
      </p>

      <p>
        One afternoon, she found herself in the old park where they once spent countless hours together.  
        A gust of wind scattered the letters from her hands, and to her astonishment, Liam appeared, catching some of them before they touched the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        Time seemed to pause as they looked into each other’s eyes, memories flooding back.  
        The years melted away, replaced by the warmth of shared laughter, familiar touches, and the unspoken bond that had never truly faded.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liam smiled, holding one of the letters gently. “I always wondered what you’d say all these years.”  
        Claire laughed through tears, realizing that love sometimes waits quietly, like letters in the wind, until the perfect moment to return.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, they read the letters aloud, reminiscing and dreaming anew, understanding that some reunions are not about finding love again—it’s about remembering that it was never lost.
