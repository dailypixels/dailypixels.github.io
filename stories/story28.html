      <p> The willow still stood where the river curved, its roots gripping the earth as if refusing to let go. Beneath it, the bench remained — faded, creaking softly when the wind brushed past. And there, like every year, <em>Daniel</em> came with his small bundle of letters. </p> <p> He always wore the same brown coat, the one she — <em>Elara</em> — had mended for him the summer before she left. The coat had aged, but her stitching held strong, delicate and sure, just like her. </p> <p> It had been fifteen years since she vanished. Not suddenly, but quietly, like dusk folding into night. No fights, no goodbyes — only a note left under the teapot: <em>“I’ll write, when I find the right words.”</em> </p> <p> And she did. One letter each year, arriving on the first day of spring. No return address. No explanation. Just pages filled with fragments — moments of faraway sunsets, cities he’d never see, and lines that read like unfinished poems. </p> <p> Daniel never stopped replying, though his letters had nowhere to go. He placed them in a small tin box beneath the willow — the same spot they’d once buried their childhood treasures. </p> <p> “If you ever find your way back,” he’d write, “you’ll find me here — still reading, still listening.” </p> <p> On the fifteenth spring, the postman brought no letter. Just silence. Daniel waited anyway. He sat under the willow till the sun bled into gold, reading the old letters one by one, his fingers tracing every curve of her handwriting. </p> <p> The last one had ended differently. Not with <em>‘Yours, Elara’</em>, but with a line that seemed to tremble off the page: <br> <em>“If I never make it back — read this where it all began.”</em> </p> <p> Daniel looked around — the same place, the same light through the branches. He dug beneath the roots, where their tin box once rested. But this time, he found something else — a sealed envelope, brittle with age, his name still clear. </p> <p> He opened it slowly. Inside, a single pressed petal and a note in her hand: <br> <em>“By the time you read this, I’ll be part of the river, the wind, the willow. You waited — and that was love enough.”</em> </p> <p> That evening, as dusk settled, a light breeze moved through the willow’s branches. Daniel closed his eyes and smiled. He didn’t cry this time. He just whispered, “I got your last letter, Elara.” </p> <p> When the morning came, the bench was empty — only the tin box remained, open to the sunlight, and inside it, two letters resting together. </p> <p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> <em>The Letters Beneath the Willow</em> speaks to love that doesn’t end — it changes form, becoming memory, wind, and silence. It reminds us that sometimes, the greatest promises are not spoken aloud but kept quietly in the places where we still wait, still remember, and still hope. 🌿💌 </p>
