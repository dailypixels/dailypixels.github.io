        I swear I only went in for bread. Just bread. Ten minutes, tops.  
        But that’s how the grocery store traps you—it lures you in with “essentials” and then slowly dismantles your dignity.
      </p>

      <p>
        First stop: produce. I reached for a perfectly innocent-looking avocado, and somehow,  
        an entire mountain of them cascaded onto the floor. Cue the judgmental stares of the other shoppers as I scrambled 
        to rebuild the avocado pyramid like I was diffusing a bomb.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, the cereal aisle. There’s a kid screaming about marshmallow bits, his mother negotiating like she’s at a hostage 
        situation. I’m just trying to grab a box of oats when the kid points at me and declares,  
        “SEE, HE GETS CEREAL!” Now I’m part of this family drama. I don’t even like cereal that much.
      </p>

      <p>
        I finally grab bread and make a break for the self-checkout, but of course, the machine decides to ruin my life.  
        “Unexpected item in the bagging area.”  
        There is no unexpected item. There is literally one loaf of bread. The attendant comes over, 
        scans a card, and gives me a look like I’m a known criminal.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I leave, bag swinging in triumph, I notice I’ve somehow purchased three energy drinks, 
        a scented candle, and a novelty mug that says “Live, Laugh, Lasagna.”  
        No memory of putting any of these in my cart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moral of the story? Grocery stores are battlefields. Bread is never “just bread.”  
        And I’m eating takeout tonight.
