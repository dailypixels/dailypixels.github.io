        The rain fell softly over the quiet city streets, a gentle rhythm that echoed the pulse of Marina’s heart. She hadn’t expected to see him again—Lucas, the person who had once held her world in his hands. Yet here he was, standing under the glow of a streetlamp, umbrella in hand, eyes searching for hers.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I thought I’d lost you forever,” Marina whispered, her voice trembling. Lucas took a careful step closer, brushing a wet strand of hair from her face. “Some things can’t be lost… not when they belong to the heart,” he replied softly. In that moment, the years of distance and silence seemed to vanish, leaving only their shared presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        They walked together beneath the rain, umbrella forgotten, sharing stories of the time apart—the joys, the trials, the moments that had shaped their paths. Every word, every laugh, every sigh reminded them that their connection had endured, quietly and unwaveringly, beneath the currents of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stopping beneath the old bridge where they had first kissed, Lucas took Marina’s hands in his. “I never stopped believing we’d find each other again,” he said. Marina’s eyes glistened with tears, “And I never stopped hoping… waiting for this moment.” They stood close, feeling the rain wash away the years, leaving only the certainty of their hearts.
      </p>

      <p>
        They lingered as the rain softened, sharing whispers, laughter, and tender touches. The city around them blurred into insignificance; in each other’s presence, they found home. The reunion was not just a rekindling of love—it was a testament to patience, faith, and the power of emotional honesty.
      </p>

      <p>
        As night deepened, they walked along the wet streets hand in hand, the soft glow of lamplight reflecting in puddles at their feet. Every step reaffirmed their bond, proving that love, when true, can survive distance, silence, and the passing of time.
