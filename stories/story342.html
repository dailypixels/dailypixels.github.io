      <p>
        In a small mountain temple stood a great bronze bell.  
        Travelers came from far away to hear its sound, but when they struck it, no echo came.  
        Disappointed, many left, calling it useless.
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, a monk explained: “The bell is not broken. Its silence teaches more than sound.  
        To hear it, you must listen with your heart, not your ears.”
      </p>

      <p>
        A pilgrim stayed, meditating before the bell each day.  
        Slowly, he began to notice the whisper of wind, the rhythm of breath, the stillness between thoughts.  
        And in that silence, he discovered a deeper harmony—the soundless ringing of peace within.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, the pilgrim told others: “The bell speaks. It does not clang—it reminds us that silence is the loudest teacher.”
