      <p>
        In the bustling lanes of Lahore’s old city, hidden between spice merchants and calligraphers, there stood a small workshop that smelled of oil and brass. Its owner, Yousaf the clockmaker, had earned a quiet reputation: he could fix any clock, no matter how broken, as if he had a pact with time itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yousaf had inherited the craft from his father, and his father before him. But unlike them, he added something unseen to every clock he repaired: a promise. He believed each clock carried a soul, bound to the people who lived by its ticking. “A clock does not only tell time,” he would say softly. “It carries the weight of moments.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, a young widow brought him a broken pocket watch. It had belonged to her late husband, a soldier who had died far from home. The glass was shattered, the hands missing. She asked him if it could be fixed. Yousaf studied it, then whispered: “This one does not need fixing. It needs listening.”
      </p>

      <p>
        For days, he worked on the watch, pausing often as if it were speaking back. Finally, when he returned it, the widow wound it gently. It ticked once, then twice, steady and alive. She pressed it to her ear and wept—it was as though her husband’s heartbeat had returned.
      </p>

      <p>
        Word spread. People came with clocks that carried their stories: a father’s desk clock, a traveler’s sundial, a grandmother’s wristwatch. Each time, Yousaf repaired more than brass and gears; he restored memories. To those who visited, his workshop became less of a shop and more of a sanctuary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet, Yousaf’s own clock—the one he wore on a chain around his neck—was never wound. It was silent, its hands forever frozen. When asked, he would smile: “This one will tick on the day I no longer can.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, when he passed away quietly at his bench, the apprentices found that old pocket watch around his neck. For the first time in decades, its hands began to move, ticking gently as if to mark his departure. They understood then: the promise had been kept. He had given time back to others, until time finally came for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, his workshop stands preserved as a museum. The walls echo with the rhythm of hundreds of clocks, each one alive with stories. Visitors lean close, listening not just to time, but to the lives stitched into its ticking. And in that symphony, the clockmaker’s promise endures—that no moment, no love, is ever truly lost.
