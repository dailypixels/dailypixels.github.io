        Jamal found the coat in a thrift stall, its fabric smoothed by many winters and one button missing from the collar. He bought it for a few coins and took it home, thinking of how his father used to stitch buttons while telling slow stories. The coat smelled faintly of cedar and rain.
      </p>

        He wore it to interviews, to bus rides, to nights when the city wind bit hard. People noticed the coat and not the missing button. One afternoon, in a crowded café, a woman struck up conversation, her eyes catching the frayed cuff. She was a seamstress named Amna who mended not only coats but people's worn edges. She offered to repair the coat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amna stitched the missing button with a thread the color of dusk and slipped into the pocket a tiny note: *“For the warmth you carry.”* Jamal later found it and felt a softness that was more than fabric. The coat had been mended; something inside him had been repaired too.
      </p>

        He began to volunteer with a shelter, offering his evenings to serve hot meals. The coat, once a simple cover, became his uniform of kindness. Months later, a young man arrived at the shelter, shivering and new to the city. Jamal draped the coat around the stranger’s shoulders without thinking. The man looked at him with disbelief, gratitude and confusion braided together.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tiny gestures multiplied; the missing button had been a doorway to connection. Amna and Jamal started a small program to teach sewing to those who wanted to rebuild their lives. The coat was mended not only by thread but by communal work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, the coat hung on a hook in the shelter with a new button and a line of patchwork pieces showing repairs and stories. It was a statement: things — and people — are not made less by wear; they are made meaningful by how we mend them.
