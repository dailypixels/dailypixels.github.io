      <p>
        When the landlord abandoned the old building, its tenants were left with peeling walls, leaking pipes, and a rooftop littered with rusted junk. Most avoided it—too broken, too forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>
        Except for Noor.
      </p>

      <p>
        She worked two jobs, came home exhausted, but every night she climbed the creaking stairs to that rooftop. Where others saw trash, she saw soil waiting to be touched.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, it was just one pot, an old tin can filled with marigold seeds. Then came basil in a cracked bucket. Tomatoes in a paint tin. Slowly, green began to creep across the rooftop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her neighbors laughed at her. “What difference will one rooftop make in this city of smoke?”
      </p>
      <p>
        But Noor kept going.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weeks passed. Then one morning, a child from the building wandered up and squealed, “It smells like rain here!” Soon, others came too—an old tailor offering scraps of cloth to tie vines, a student carrying leftover water from her kettle, a widow planting jasmine in memory of her husband.
      </p>
      <p>
        By summer, the rooftop was no longer forgotten. It had become a small jungle in the sky, alive with butterflies, laughter, and the smell of earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The landlord returned, furious. He wanted rent, not flowers. But when he saw children reading under the shade of sunflowers, when he tasted a tomato handed shyly to him by the widow, his anger broke. “Keep it,” he muttered, almost embarrassed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years later, when the building was finally repaired, the rooftop garden stayed. It was no longer Noor’s alone—it was theirs. Proof that beauty blooms not from wealth or perfection, but from persistence.
      </p>

        Meaning / Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        This story shows that <b>hope is contagious</b>. A single act of care, however small, can inspire a community to transform decay into life. Even the most neglected places can become gardens.
