        The old bridge hadn’t changed much in ten years. The wood still creaked under my weight, 
        the lanterns flickered with the same golden glow, and the river below carried the same soft hum of waves. 
        Time had painted its surface with moss and cracks, but to me, it was still the place where everything began.
      </p>

      <p>
        I could still see her there, that day in spring—laughing as the wind snatched her scarf and sent it sailing 
        into my hands. She had thanked me with a smile so bright it lingered in my memory for weeks. 
        That smile had turned into long conversations, midnight walks, and years of shared dreams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Life, however, had its own plans. Work, distance, and time pulled us apart. 
        Messages slowed, calls grew shorter, and eventually, silence filled the spaces where laughter used to be. 
        But tonight, something told me to come back.
      </p>

      <p>
        I stood at the center of the bridge, watching the sun dip below the horizon, 
        painting the sky in orange and lavender hues. That’s when I heard footsteps—soft, hesitant. 
        My heart skipped. I turned, and there she was.
      </p>

      <p>
        She hadn’t changed much. Her hair was shorter, her style different, 
        but her eyes—those warm, unguarded eyes—were exactly the same. 
        “I thought I’d find you here,” she whispered, as if afraid to break the quiet magic of the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn’t know what to say. Years of words had built up in my chest, 
        but all I managed was a soft, “I missed you.” 
        She smiled, that same smile that had started everything, and stepped closer. 
        The space between us disappeared like the years had never passed.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the lanterns flickered to life, she reached for my hand. “Maybe,” she said, 
        “we could try again.”  
        And in that moment, with the river’s song beneath us and the city’s lights awakening around us, 
        I knew the bridge wasn’t just a memory—it was a beginning, once again.
