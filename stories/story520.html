        Laila was a young journalist, known for asking questions that cut deeper than headlines. Her show was modest, but her audience was loyal—because she pursued truth when others feared it. 
      </p>

      <p>
        One night, she secured an interview with a politician accused of corruption. The studio lights burned hot, the microphones hummed, and millions tuned in. For thirty minutes, the guest dodged her questions with charm and rehearsed lines. But then Laila asked one question that stopped him cold: “When you look in the mirror, do you see a man serving his people, or a man serving himself?”
      </p>

      <p>
        He froze. The silence stretched. He forced a smile, changed the subject, and the program ended without an answer. Viewers erupted—not because of what he said, but because of what he could not.
      </p>

      <p>
        That single unanswered question spread across the nation. It became a slogan, written on placards, painted on walls, whispered in protests. Laila realized then that journalism was not only about answers—it was about asking the questions that demanded reflection long after cameras stopped rolling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, people would still recall that interview. Some forgot the politician’s name, but none forgot the question. It lingered in the public conscience, proving that silence sometimes speaks louder than words.
