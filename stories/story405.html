      <p>
        Professor Anwar spent his life studying the stars. From the time he was a boy, lying on rooftops with a hand-made telescope, he had searched the skies for answers. His work brought him respect, but in his old age, he felt something was still missing.  
      </p>

      <p>
        On his final night, weak and frail, he asked his students to wheel him outside beneath the winter sky. As the telescope was adjusted, he whispered, “I have always looked for God in the stars, but perhaps He was in the silence between them.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        His students listened quietly as he spoke of how science had given him facts, but wonder had given him meaning. “The stars,” he said, “are not only suns—they are reminders of how small we are, and how infinite love must be to hold all this together.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, as his eyes closed for the last time, the students looked upward. The sky seemed brighter, as if the heavens had welcomed him. And though the professor’s voice was gone, his words echoed: *Faith begins where calculation ends.*  
      </p>

      <p>
        In every stargazer who came after, his legacy lived on—not in charts or equations, but in wonder.
