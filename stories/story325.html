        In the 15th century, Prague’s streets buzzed with gossip of the clockmaker, Master Havel. He had crafted an astronomical clock unlike any the world had seen—marking not only hours but stars, seasons, and phases of the moon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kings and travelers came to marvel at its precision. But with fame came envy. Rumors swirled that foreign lords wanted to steal his secrets. To protect the masterpiece, the city council demanded Havel swear an oath never to build another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Heartbroken, he obeyed. Yet he poured his soul into every gear, every stroke of gold paint, knowing it would outlive him. On the day he died, the clock rang louder than ever, as if mourning its maker.
      </p>

      <p>
        Centuries later, the clock still ticks in Prague’s Old Town. Crowds gather beneath it daily, never knowing the sacrifice that made it eternal.
