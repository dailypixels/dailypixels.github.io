        In the heart of the old bazaar stood a tiny shop where time never seemed to move. Dozens of clocks ticked in perfect unison, their rhythm hypnotic. The owner, an elderly clockmaker named Yousaf, was known more for his silence than his craft.
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, a student entered, curious about the dusty shelves. Yousaf showed him a peculiar clock—its hands moved backward. “This one,” he whispered, “remembers what people choose to forget.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The boy laughed, until the clock began ticking in reverse, replaying fragments of his childhood. Forgotten laughter. A friend he had betrayed. A promise left broken. Tears welled up—memories he had buried were alive again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yousaf closed the case gently. “Time doesn’t erase, child. It simply hides until you are ready to face it.” The boy left, shaken but changed, carrying a truth no lesson could teach.
