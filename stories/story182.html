     <p>Clara sat in the tiny café overlooking the Seine, the rain drizzling softly against the window. She unfolded a letter tied with a red ribbon, her heart quickening as she read the familiar handwriting. It was from Lucien, a man she had never met in person, yet whose words had filled her days with warmth for months. Their letters had begun by chance: a misdelivered envelope, an apology, and then a reply that sparked a connection neither could ignore. Every letter unveiled stories, dreams, fears, and laughter. They shared their lives through ink and paper, the city around them serving as a silent witness to their growing affection. One chilly morning, Lucien had written of a small surprise: a bench by the river, beneath the cherry trees, at dawn. Clara’s hands trembled as she stepped onto the cobblestone path. There he stood, coat damp from the mist, eyes searching for her. Time seemed to stretch and collapse as they approached each other. No words were needed; the months of letters spoke in a language all their own. Lucien handed her a final envelope, the seal unbroken. “For you,” he said softly. Clara opened it to find a single sentence: *“Meet me here, always, and let the rest of our story begin.”* Tears mingled with laughter as they embraced, the river sparkling in the early morning light. In that moment, they realized that love, sometimes, finds you in the quietest corners and the smallest gestures, binding souls even before faces meet. The city whispered around them, but the world had narrowed to just the two of them, their hearts echoing the rhythm of the Seine.</p>
