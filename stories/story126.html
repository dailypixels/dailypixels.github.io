    <main class="story-content">
     <p>When the postman handed Mara an envelope yellowed with age, she nearly dropped it. The handwriting was her husband’s — Elias — who had died ten years ago. Her heart stuttered as she opened it, breath trembling between disbelief and longing.</p>

<p>Inside, the ink had bled in places, but the words were clear: *“If you ever find this, I hope you’ve learned to forgive me for leaving. I didn’t go to escape you — I went to find the courage to come back.”*</p>

<p>Tears fell onto the paper, smudging what time had not erased. She read it twice, then three times, until the ache softened into warmth. For the first time in a decade, she opened the window. The air smelled like rain and possibility. She whispered, “You did come back, Elias. In your words.”</p>

<p>Outside, the wind lifted the curtain, carrying the scent of lilacs — his favorite. And for a moment, she felt a hand brush hers, gentle and forgiving, as if the past itself had exhaled peace.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Letter</em> is a story about the endurance of love beyond time and death. It reminds us that closure doesn’t always come from answers — sometimes it comes from the quiet arrival of understanding. Even when everything fades, words can still return to heal what silence once broke. 💌🕊️</p>
