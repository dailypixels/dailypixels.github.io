        A folded note flew out of her hands, caught by the wind, twisting and dancing across the park. She held her breath, watching it drift. *“You are stronger than you think,”* it read in her handwriting.  
        Somewhere, someone else might find it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Days later, she received a message from a stranger: *“Your note found me when I needed it most. Thank you.”*  
        And just like that, she realized small gestures carried ripples far beyond what the eye could see.
