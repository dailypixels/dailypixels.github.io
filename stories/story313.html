      <p>
        Every afternoon after school, Liam and Jonah met at the same weathered bench beneath the giant oak tree in their town park. It was their place—where they traded secrets, shared homework answers, and dreamed about the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        As they grew older, life began pulling them apart. Jonah moved to another city for college, while Liam stayed to work at his father’s shop. Messages became less frequent, calls shorter. But the bench remained, holding years of laughter and promises.
      </p>

      <p>
        One autumn afternoon, after nearly a decade apart, Liam returned to the park, uncertain if Jonah would come. As the leaves fell, he saw a figure walking toward the oak. It was Jonah, holding two cups of coffee. Without words, they sat down, the silence heavy with all that had been missed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then Jonah smiled. “Still our bench?” he asked. Liam nodded, tears burning his eyes. In that moment, they realized true friendship was not measured by time spent together, but by the certainty that, no matter how far apart life pulled them, they would always find their way back to that bench.
      </p>

      <p>
        The oak, now older and stronger, stood witness once again—not to boys with dreams, but to men whose bond had weathered every season.
