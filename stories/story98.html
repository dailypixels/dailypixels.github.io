    <main class="story-content">
     <p> The theater smelled of dust and memory. The seats were empty, the velvet faded, and the echo of applause long since vanished. But for <em>Adrian Voss</em>, the stage had always been home — a place where he could hide behind every mask but his own. </p>

<p> For forty years, Adrian had been the heart of the Verona Royal Theater. He’d played kings, beggars, and fools — yet offstage, he had lived as a ghost of himself. The critics adored his tragedies, never knowing that his greatest one was not written in any script. </p>

<p> Thirty years ago, during a production of *The Fall of Caesar*, a young understudy named <em>Elena</em> — full of fire and talent — had fallen from the upper stage balcony during rehearsal. She had been Adrian’s secret love and his rival in brilliance. Her death was ruled an accident. Only Adrian knew the truth: his jealousy had caused him to loosen the railing she leaned on, intending only to scare her. But fate had turned the prank into tragedy. </p>

<p> The guilt had never left him. He buried it beneath roles, applause, and fame. Yet as the theater prepared to close forever, Adrian was asked to perform one final time — a farewell performance written just for him. He accepted, knowing it would be his confession. </p>

<p> On the night of the show, the city’s old audience returned — gray-haired patrons, fellow actors, and students who had once idolized him. The lights dimmed, and Adrian stepped into the golden glow of the stage. </p>

<p> The play began with laughter, then sorrow, mirroring his life. As the final act arrived, Adrian dropped his script and spoke his own lines. The audience watched in silence as he told the story of a man consumed by envy, who took away the only light that ever loved him. He spoke Elena’s name. He described the balcony, the fall, the scream. </p>

<p> “I have lived a thousand lives on this stage,” he said, voice trembling, “but never the one that mattered. Tonight, I live it true.” </p>

<p> The curtain fell. The audience rose — not in applause, but in stunned silence. When the lights returned, Adrian’s chair was empty. He had taken his final bow and walked out into the rain, disappearing down Verona Street as quietly as he had entered it forty years ago. </p>

<p> Days later, when the staff cleared his dressing room, they found a note pinned to the mirror: <em>“Truth is the last role we ever play — and the only one we can’t rehearse.”</em> </p>

<p> The theater never reopened. But each spring, a single red rose appears on the dusty stage floor, its petals fresh and wet with dew, as if someone still waits for the curtain to rise again. </p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
*The Last Curtain* is a story about guilt, art, and redemption — how we spend our lives performing for others, yet our true freedom begins when we perform for ourselves. It reminds us that forgiveness often begins not with others, but with the courage to confess, to stand in the light, and to speak the truth aloud. 🎭🌹 </p>


      <p class="end-note">
        Riley knew the battle wasn’t over.  
        The city might be safe for now, but shadows lingered in every network,  
        and trust would never come easily again.
