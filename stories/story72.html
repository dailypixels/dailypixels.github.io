      <p>
        Alex and Jordan had been inseparable since childhood.  
        They built forts in the woods, shared comic books,  
        and later, secrets no one else knew.  
        But adulthood pulled them apart—different colleges,  
        different cities, different lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, fate brought them back to their hometown.  
        The wooden bridge where they once carved their initials  
        was still standing, though weathered and frail.  
        They sat on its edge, legs dangling above the stream,  
        silence heavy with all the years they had lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I thought you forgot about this place,” Jordan said softly.  
        Alex shook his head.  
        “I never forgot. I just didn’t know if you wanted me here.”  
        Their laughter from younger days seemed to echo in the breeze,  
        fragile but alive.
      </p>

      <p>
        They spoke for hours—about failures, victories, heartbreaks,  
        and the people who came and went.  
        Time slipped away until stars filled the sky.  
        For the first time in years, both felt lighter,  
        as though the bridge itself carried their burdens away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before leaving, Jordan pulled out a pocketknife.  
        Next to their old initials, he carved the date.  
        “So we’ll never forget again,” he said.  
        Alex smiled, tears blurring his vision.  
        The bridge wasn’t just wood and nails.  
        It was proof that even after years of silence,  
        true friendship could still hold strong.
