      <p>
        In an antique shop in Multan, an old clock ticked faintly, though no one had wound it for decades. Behind the counter, the shopkeeper explained that it was made by a legendary clockmaker who disappeared mysteriously in 1910.
      </p>

      <p>
        A historian named Nida purchased it, fascinated by its unbroken rhythm. One evening, while polishing its gears, she discovered a hidden compartment inside the frame. Within lay a folded parchment: designs for inventions far ahead of their time—solar heating, self-winding mechanisms, even water-purifying filters.
      </p>

      <p>
        The clockmaker had not vanished; he had been silenced. His ideas threatened powerful men who profited from keeping progress slow. Nida realized she held not just a clock, but a fragment of stolen history.
      </p>

      <p>
        She published the findings, and the name of the forgotten clockmaker was restored. The clock’s steady rhythm became more than sound—it was justice delayed, but not denied.
