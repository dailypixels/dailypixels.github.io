      <p>
        Ethan had dreamed of becoming a renowned painter, but years of rejection and self-doubt weighed heavily on him.  
        His canvases often sat untouched, his colors muted by fear of failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, a mentor visited his small studio. She examined his work and said, “Talent is only half the story. The rest is courage—the courage to paint, to fail, and to continue.”  
        Inspired, Ethan began painting every day, embracing mistakes as lessons rather than setbacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Slowly, his style emerged, bold and confident. Gallery owners began to notice, and one evening, his first solo exhibition was celebrated not only for skill but for the authenticity and perseverance it embodied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ethan realized that success isn’t about instant recognition—it’s about persistent effort, embracing imperfection, and never giving up on your passion, even when the world seems indifferent.
