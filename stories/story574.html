      <p>
        The year was 1918.
The war had silenced more hearts than guns ever could. Among them was Elara’s — waiting in the ruins of a home that once smelled of lavender and ink.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her husband, Captain Aiden Rowe, had written her every day from the front.
Letters filled with pressed flowers, small sketches, and promises.
But one winter night, the telegram came — “Missing in action.”
      </p>

      <p>
        For months she waited, until the bombs reached even the village that had never seen the front.
When the fire came, she carried only one thing — his letters.
But when the flames died, they were gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        All except one.
      </p>

      <p>
        It lay in the ashes, untouched, bound by a red ribbon.
She opened it with trembling hands. The ink shimmered faintly, though no candle burned nearby.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you find this, Elara, I did not make it home. But I have left pieces of my time for you — in the watch I fixed, in the tree by the hill. There, I will wait.”
      </p>

      <p>
        She followed his words to the old oak on the outskirts of the village.
And there, half-buried beneath roots and mud, she found the watch.
It was still ticking — slow, steady — as if keeping time only for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she pressed it to her chest, the wind changed.
For a moment, she swore she heard him say, “You waited long enough.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning, when her neighbors found her, she was sitting peacefully beneath the oak — the watch beside her, finally still.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Meaning / Reflection:
      </h2>

      <p>
        Love can outlive even the ruins of war.
Some promises are stronger than time — written not in ink, but in memory that refuses to fade.
