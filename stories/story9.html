        We hadn’t seen each other in years, but the second Jamie pulled up in his beat-up truck, it was like no time had passed. 
        We had a plan—a simple road trip along winding mountain roads, no itinerary, just miles of forest and a cooler full of snacks. 
        It felt like being sixteen again, windows down, music blaring, laughter echoing off the trees.
      </p>

      <p>
        Late that afternoon, we stumbled on a dirt road that wasn’t on the map. Curiosity won, and we followed it through a tunnel of towering pines until it ended at a bridge—old, wooden, and half-swallowed by moss. 
        The boards creaked under our feet as we crossed, and the smell of cedar and rain hung in the air. The whole place felt like it was holding its breath.
      </p>

        “Feels like a movie set,” Jamie whispered, peering over the edge. Below, a river rushed between boulders, glinting like glass in the fading light. 
        On the far side of the bridge, we found carvings in the wood: names, initials, and dates going back decades. A time capsule of strangers who’d stood here, hearts pounding, like ours.
      </p>

        We added our names with a pocketknife Jamie had carried since high school, laughing at how clumsy our letters looked. 
        Then we sat on the bridge, legs dangling, trading stories until the sky turned purple and the first stars blinked awake. 
        The world felt enormous but safe, like that bridge had been waiting just for us.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the way back to the truck, Jamie said, “We’re gonna come back here someday, right?” 
        I nodded, even though I wasn’t sure when. But some places stay with you—the smell of pine, the sound of water, the weight of a friend’s laughter next to you. 
        That night, as we drove away, headlights cutting through the dark forest road, I felt like we’d found something worth carrying forever.
