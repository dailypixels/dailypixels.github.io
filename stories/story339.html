      <p>
        Jason had always dreamed of climbing the tallest mountain in his country, but life, work, and excuses pushed the dream further away.  
        When he turned forty, something inside him whispered: *“If not now, then when?”*
      </p>

      <p>
        Training was brutal. His legs screamed, his lungs burned, and every step up the practice trails reminded him how unprepared he was.  
        Yet, with every stumble, he grew stronger. Friends doubted him, some laughed at the idea, but Jason refused to surrender.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the final climb, a storm rolled in, lashing wind against his body. He was cold, terrified, and close to giving up.  
        But then he remembered his late father’s words: *“The biggest mountains aren’t outside, son. They’re the ones inside us.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        Summoning everything he had, Jason pressed on. Hours later, he stood at the summit, tears streaming down his frozen cheeks.  
        The mountain wasn’t just beneath his feet—it was within him, conquered by courage, persistence, and heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        From that day, Jason realized success was never about the peak, but about who he became climbing toward it.
