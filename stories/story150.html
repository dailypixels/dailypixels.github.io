      <p>
        Detective Rowan received a cryptic radio transmission at midnight—a sequence of tones that didn’t match any known code.  
        It was coming from the abandoned Eastwick radio tower, a place rumored to be haunted by a past disappearance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arriving at the tower, the air was thick with fog, and shadows stretched unnaturally.  
        Rowan climbed the spiraling staircase, hearing whispers of a voice she recognized—a missing colleague she had long mourned.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the top, the equipment was running on its own. Screens flickered, displaying maps and timestamps of events that hadn’t occurred yet.  
        She realized someone—or something—was predicting movements, using the tower as a conduit to control and observe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, a figure stepped out from the shadows. It was her colleague, alive, but altered—calm, emotionless, and claiming to have “seen the patterns of time.”  
        Rowan was faced with a choice: trust him and uncover the truth or escape, leaving the tower’s secrets behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        As she hesitated, the signals changed. The tower began to emit a powerful pulse, revealing that reality had been subtly manipulated all along.  
        Rowan barely escaped, but the last flicker of the screens showed her own reflection inside the tower—suggesting that the line between observer and participant had forever blurred.
