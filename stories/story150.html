      <p><strong>Part I: The Call of the Ridge</strong></p>

<p>The sun barely touched the snowcaps when Rowan Keller reached the base camp of the Ghoran Peaks — the range known among mountaineers as “The Peaks of No Return.” He was sixty-one, his joints creaked with every step, and yet the fire in his eyes burned brighter than the oxygen torch in his pack.</p>

<p>He wasn’t here for glory or fame. He was here for closure.</p>

<p>Thirty-five years earlier, his younger brother Eli had vanished on this very ridge during an expedition. The storm that swept through that night had erased all traces of him. The mountain took him — and with him, Rowan’s will to climb again. Until now.</p>

<p>“This is madness,” said Anya, his Sherpa companion, tightening her gloves. “The north ridge is cursed.”</p>

<p>Rowan smiled faintly. “Then I suppose I’m going to meet the curse myself.”</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part II: Into Thin Air</strong></p>

<p>They began the ascent at dawn. Each breath was a war. The wind screamed through the narrow passes, hurling knives of ice against their faces. The cliffs were glassed with frost, and the rope between them shuddered under gusts that could swallow a man whole.</p>

<p>At 16,000 feet, Anya stopped. “We should turn back,” she said. “The storm’s building.”</p>

<p>Rowan’s eyes fixed on the jagged crest above — the same one that had haunted his dreams for decades. “I can’t,” he said softly. “I owe him this.”</p>

<p>He pressed forward alone.</p>

<p>The clouds folded in, smothering the ridge in white. Snow blurred sky and earth until everything vanished — except the sound of his heartbeat, loud and desperate. His vision flickered, his limbs trembled. Somewhere in that blinding void, he heard a voice.</p>

<p><em>“You finally came, brother.”</em></p>

<p>He turned — no one. Just the mountain breathing.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part III: The Frozen Summit</strong></p>

<p>When the wind broke, the summit appeared — jagged, silver, almost holy. Rowan dragged himself onto the final ledge, every muscle screaming, and collapsed to his knees. From his pack, he drew a small tin box — Eli’s compass, still scratched from their last climb together.</p>

<p>He placed it in the snow and whispered, “You can rest now.”</p>

<p>The silence that followed wasn’t empty — it was full. The air stilled, the clouds parted, and sunlight struck the peak in gold. He felt warmth rise in his chest — not from the sun, but from something within. For the first time in decades, he felt peace.</p>

<p>When Anya found him hours later, he was sitting quietly on the ridge’s edge, looking out over the endless white valleys below. “Did you find what you were looking for?” she asked.</p>

<p>He smiled through cracked lips. “Not what — who. And maybe... myself.”</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part IV: Descent</strong></p>

<p>They descended slowly as dusk painted the sky in amber. The mountain no longer seemed cruel or monstrous — only vast, eternal, and honest. At the base, Rowan turned once more to look back.</p>

<p>“Goodbye, Eli,” he murmured. “You’ve been waiting on that ridge long enough.”</p>

<p>He left the Ghoran Peaks behind, his brother’s memory finally set free — like snow melting into spring water, feeding the rivers below.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Peaks of No Return</em> reminds us that adventure isn’t always about reaching new places — sometimes it’s about returning to the ones that broke us, and finding peace there. True courage lies not in conquering the mountain, but in healing the climb within. 🏔️✨</p>
