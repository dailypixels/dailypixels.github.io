        Every Sunday, the same bench at the bus stop filled with familiar faces: an old teacher with a satchel, a young mother with a sleeping baby, a mailman between shifts, and an artist with smudged fingers. They rarely spoke beyond greetings, but their presence formed an unspoken map of neighborhood life.
      </p>

      <p>
        One humid morning, the bus was late. The sky threatened rain. The old teacher offered his umbrella, then the artist unfolded a sketchbook, and the mailman produced packets of sticky toffee he'd saved from a café. Small kindnesses slipped between them like secret currency.
      </p>

      <p>
        Conversation unfurled slowly. The teacher recited a line of poetry that made the young mother laugh; the artist sketched the baby’s sleeping face; the mailman talked about a letter that had taken years to arrive. They found themselves sharing moments that felt larger than the thirty minutes they had before the bus would arrive.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the bus finally came, no one stood quickly. The act of waiting had become a gentle ritual — a place where ordinary people traded stories and small favors that knitted their days together. They exchanged numbers that week not because they needed to, but because they had discovered how comforting a bench can be when held in common.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks later, when one neighbor fell ill, the bench's network showed itself: soup left on porches, a cousin called, errands run. The bus stop had not only been a place to wait; it had been a place to learn how to be present for one another.
