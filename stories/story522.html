        After losing her husband, painter Sofia found her studio unbearable. Canvases stood half-finished, colors dulled. She told herself she was done with art. But grief has strange ways of returning you to yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, she stood before a blank canvas. Her hand trembled as she lifted the brush. Instead of portraits or landscapes, she painted silence—broad strokes of gray, faint washes of blue, raw textures that spoke of absence. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Neighbors who visited her small exhibition months later stood quietly before her work. Some wept, some smiled faintly, but all felt something stir. Sofia realized then that her art was no longer about perfection—it was about honesty. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The canvas had not healed her loss, but it had given shape to her silence. And sometimes, that was enough.
