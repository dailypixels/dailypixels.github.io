      <p>The typewriter sat in the center of the room like an altar.</p>

<p>Rania hesitated before it. The keys were dusted with gold from sunlight, the ribbon long dry. For years, rumors said the great writer Ilyas Rahim had stopped writing because “he had nothing left to say.” Now, sitting across from him, she realized it wasn’t that simple.</p>

<p>“Everyone thought you disappeared,” she said, setting her recorder down. “Your last book changed people’s lives. Then—silence. Why?”</p>

<p>Ilyas smiled faintly, lines etching deeper into his weathered face. “Because silence is also a language, Miss Rania. The only one I hadn’t yet learned.”</p>

<p>“But your readers waited,” she pressed gently. “They believed you’d return.”</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair. “Ah, belief. That’s the cruelest kind of love, isn’t it? They wanted words to save them. But I realized something: words can only point to truth—they can’t hold it.”</p>

<p>Rania frowned slightly. “You mean your writing failed?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, voice soft as smoke. “It succeeded too well. People began to quote me, not question me. They replaced thinking with remembering. That’s when I stopped. A writer should spark thought, not replace it.”</p>

<p>She looked around at the silent books. “So what have you been doing all these years?”</p>

<p>Ilyas chuckled. “Listening. To the words I never wrote. They speak louder in quiet rooms.”</p>

<p>She paused the recorder. “If you could write one last sentence,” she asked, “what would it be?”</p>

<p>He smiled, eyes glimmering with something between mischief and peace. “It would begin with a question,” he said, “and end with a mirror.”</p>

<p>Outside, the wind carried the faint sound of chimes — like keys tapping against each other — an unfinished story whispering through the air.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
Some truths live better in silence.  
Ilyas reminds us that words are not cages for meaning but doors to it.  
The greatest writing doesn’t fill space — it leaves room for thought to breathe.</p>
