      <p>
        Leo had always been the dependable one, the friend everyone leaned on. But when life threw him unexpected challenges—losing his job and facing a lonely winter—he realized that sometimes even the strongest need a shoulder to lean on.
      </p>

      <p>
        His friends noticed his quiet withdrawal and decided to remind him of the bond that had carried them through countless adventures. One afternoon, they invited him to a secluded wooden bridge overlooking a calm river, a place where they had shared laughter, secrets, and countless promises as children.
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing together, they handed Leo small handwritten notes, each one a reminder of memories, encouragement, and dreams yet to be realized. “We promised to be here for each other,” one friend said, “and we always will be.” Leo felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes as he read each note, realizing that the weight he had carried alone could now be shared.
      </p>

      <p>
        They spent hours reminiscing, planning, and laughing until the sun dipped behind the horizon. Each story shared, every hand held, reminded Leo that friendship was more than just companionship—it was a sanctuary, a bridge over life’s turbulent waters.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time twilight fell, Leo felt a renewed sense of hope and strength. He understood that asking for help wasn’t weakness, that leaning on others didn’t lessen his courage—it amplified it. Surrounded by friends who had never let him falter, he knew that life’s storms were easier to weather when shared.
