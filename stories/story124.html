      <p>
        Ben and Leo had been friends since childhood, sharing adventures, secrets, and dreams of seeing the world.  
        Now adults, life had scattered them, but their bond remained as steadfast as the lighthouse they used to visit.
      </p>

      <p>
        One summer, they returned to the old lighthouse, each carrying the weight of personal struggles.  
        As they climbed the spiral staircase together, memories of laughter and mischief echoed through the walls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing at the top, overlooking the vast ocean, Leo confessed his fear of failure and Ben shared his doubts about the future.  
        They realized that true friendship isn’t about having all the answers—it’s about offering support, perspective, and courage when the world feels uncertain.
      </p>

      <p>
        They spent the evening lighting lanterns atop the lighthouse, symbolizing hope for each other’s paths.  
        The glowing lights reflected on the water, a testament to resilience, trust, and the unwavering guidance friends provide through life’s storms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walking down together, they knew that the lighthouse was more than a structure—it was a reminder that even in the darkest times, friendship can illuminate the way forward.
