        The storm had cut off the mountain lodge for three days. Food supplies dwindled, the radio crackled with static, and the temperature dropped lower than the thermometer could register. Yet, on the fourth morning, when Arif stepped outside, he saw them—footprints in the snow leading away from the cabin.

      <p>
        No one in the group claimed them. They all swore they hadn’t left during the night. Panic brewed in the air thicker than the frost. Who had walked out? Or worse—who had walked in?
      </p>

      <p>
        The trail led into the forest, where the trees stood like guards. Arif followed cautiously, the crunch of his boots echoing too loudly. After a mile, the footprints stopped abruptly, as though the person had vanished into thin air. No drag marks, no return trail. Just emptiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, they heard it—soft steps circling the cabin. Each crunch of snow was deliberate, measured, as though someone wanted them to know they were not alone. Sleep abandoned the lodge; fear became their only companion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the morning, new prints surrounded the cabin entirely, a ring of silence in the snow. Whoever—or whatever—it was, had marked its territory. And Arif realized survival wasn’t just about enduring the cold, but about outlasting whatever watched them from the forest.
