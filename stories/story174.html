        Detective Riley had seen the worst humanity could offer, but the case at Hollow Creek haunted him. A prominent lawyer was found dead in his mansion, seemingly from natural causes, but Riley sensed something off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Surveillance footage was missing, alarms were disabled, and the mansion’s staff claimed they saw nothing unusual. Riley pored over evidence, searching for the smallest anomaly, the overlooked detail that could expose the truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Late one night, while reviewing audio from the lawyer’s security system, Riley heard faint tapping—patterned, rhythmic, almost like a code. Following the pattern led him to a secret room hidden behind a bookcase, filled with documents revealing corruption, blackmail, and betrayal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, Riley realized the twist: the lawyer had faked his death to escape the web of enemies he had created. But in doing so, he left behind clues, trusting that only the right observer—the detective with patience and intuition—would uncover the truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Riley stepped out into the empty street, the cold night air sharp against his face. Hollow Creek had its secrets, but he had learned that in the silence of observation, nothing truly goes unnoticed.
