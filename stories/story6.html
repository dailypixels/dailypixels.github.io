      <p>
        I arrived at the lake just as dusk began to settle, the sky ablaze with pastel streaks of rose and amber. Clouds towered above the mirrored surface, their reflections drifting silently across the water like ghosts of daylight.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wooden jetty felt impossibly long beneath my feet, pointing toward the horizon where the last light clung to the mountains beyond. Each breath came slower here, as if time had softened its pace and allowed space for memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        I sat at the edge, letting the water lap gently against the planks. Nearby, a lone rowboat floated, tethered yet free in its reflection. It seemed to hold a story—of journeys begun and left unfinished, of passengers who whispered secrets to the wind.
      </p>

      <p>
        In that half-light, past and present merged. I could almost hear echoes—laughing voices, the creak of oars, the soft hush of goodbyes. Every ripple felt like a fragment, a reminder that sometimes silence speaks loudest when the world pauses between day and night.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the first star appeared above the mountains, the lake darkened to ink. The reflections softened, and I stood to leave—carrying with me the quiet resonance of twilight, and the knowing that every ending holds the promise of reflection.
