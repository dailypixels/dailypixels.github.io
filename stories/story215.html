    <main class="story-content">
     <p>It was raining when Clara Mendez moved into Apartment 13B. The hallway lights flickered like a dying heartbeat, and the air smelled faintly of dust and metal. She’d come for peace — a quiet place to finish her book after years of chasing crime stories across the city. But the building, old and gray, felt like it had a memory of its own.</p>

<p>Her first night was uneventful. She unpacked, made tea, and fell asleep to the hum of rain on the windows. But the next morning, something strange waited at her door — a single sheet of paper slipped beneath the frame. Typed neatly, no signature.</p>

<p><em>“You always lock your door twice before bed. Just like the others.”</em></p>

<p>Clara froze. The note had no explanation, no threat — just observation. She checked the hallway. Empty. Her neighbors were quiet people — a retired couple in 13A, a nurse in 13C, and a man who rarely left his apartment on the floor below. Still, someone had been close enough to watch her.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, more notes appeared. Always early morning. Always personal.</p>

<p><em>“You sleep with the light on.”</em><br>
<em>“You cry when you think no one can hear.”</em><br>
<em>“You keep the blinds half open, but never fully.”</em></p>

<p>Clara started keeping a journal, documenting every sound, every shadow. Her instincts as a reporter kicked in — she asked the landlord about security cameras. He laughed dryly. “This place is too old for that kind of thing,” he said. “Besides, no one’s ever complained before.”</p>

<p>That night, she taped her door shut, a thin strip of paper across the bottom so she’d know if anyone entered. By morning, it was still sealed — but another note waited on her counter.</p>

<p><em>“You’re smart, Clara. But not smart enough to stop watching.”</em></p>

<p>Her heart pounded. Someone had been inside. She tore through the apartment — nothing out of place. Then she saw it: her laptop, open on the desk, a document on the screen she hadn’t written.</p>

<p><em>“Every story begins with curiosity. But not every story wants to be told.”</em></p>

<p>That night, Clara called the police. They checked the building, took her statement, and left. “Probably a prank,” one officer said. But she saw the unease in his eyes when she showed him the notes. He promised to patrol the area for a few nights.</p>

<p>She didn’t sleep. Every creak sounded like footsteps. Every gust of wind whispered her name. At 3:07 a.m., her phone buzzed. An email from an unknown sender. Subject line: *Look outside.*</p>

<p>Her breath hitched. Slowly, she walked to the window. Across the courtyard, in a dark apartment opposite hers, a faint glow flickered. The silhouette of a person stood at the window — tall, unmoving, watching.</p>

<p>Then the power went out.</p>

<p>She grabbed her phone flashlight and stumbled to the door. The hallway was pitch black. Somewhere down the corridor, a door creaked. Then another. A whisper: “Clara...”</p>

<p>Her phone light trembled across peeling wallpaper until it caught a glimpse of something — a handprint on her door. Fresh. Smudged in black ink.</p>

<p>She bolted back inside, locked the door, and pressed her back against it. Her heart thundered so loud she barely heard the next sound — a quiet knock, three times, deliberate.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she shouted.</p>

<p>Silence. Then a low voice through the door: “The one writing your ending.”</p>

<p>The next morning, the police found Apartment 13B empty. The door was locked from the inside, windows sealed, no sign of forced entry. On the kitchen counter lay Clara’s laptop, still open. The document read:</p>

<p><em>“The watcher always becomes the watched.”</em></p>

<p>They never found her. But weeks later, a new tenant moved into 13B — a quiet man with a journalist’s badge tucked into his wallet. On his first morning, he found a note under his door.</p>

<p><em>“Welcome, neighbor. You lock your door twice before bed.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Watcher in Apartment 13B</em> is a story about curiosity and fear — how the line between observer and victim can vanish in the dark. It reminds us that some truths are better left unwritten, and that the act of watching always comes with a price. 🕯️👁️</p>
