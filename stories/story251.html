    <main class="story-content">
      <p>In the kingdom of Aeloria, the sun had not risen in two hundred years.</p>

<p>Children were born beneath silver moons, crops glowed faintly with star-dust, and every street lamp burned with conjured flame. The world had forgotten warmth. Legends said that the sun’s heart — the Ember of Dawn — had been stolen by the Shadow King and sealed deep within the Frosted Vale, where no mortal dared to tread.</p>

<p>Among the starving and the cold lived a boy named Cael, an orphan who scavenged ruins and traded old copper for bread. He’d never seen sunlight, but he’d heard stories from the oldest dreamers — stories of gold skies and green forests. He laughed at them once. But that changed the night he found the lantern.</p>

<hr>

<p>It was buried beneath an abandoned watchtower, half-swallowed by ice. The lantern was unlike any he’d seen — etched with runes that pulsed faintly when he touched them. Inside, a spark flickered — not white, not blue, but <em>warm.</em></p>

<p>When his fingers brushed the glass, the flame blazed, filling the ruins with light that made his breath hitch. It was gentle, not searing. The first real warmth he had ever felt.</p>

<p>That’s when the whisper came.</p>

<p><em>“Bearer of the Light... the dawn remembers you.”</em></p>

<p>He staggered back. “Who said that?”</p>

<p><em>“The Lantern of Aeloria,”</em> the voice replied, echoing from within the flame. <em>“Take me home.”</em></p>

<hr>

<p>That night, the constables of the Shadow Guard found him. They’d seen the light — and no light but theirs was allowed to shine. Cael fled through frozen alleys, clutching the lantern to his chest. Arrows hissed past his head; one struck the cobbles beside him, scattering frost.</p>

<p>He ran beyond the city walls, toward the forbidden Vale — the place where no sound carried and no bird flew. The ground was glassy, the sky heavy with unbroken dark. Still, the lantern’s flame glowed steady, guiding his steps.</p>

<p>Days passed. He crossed valleys of black ice and rivers of shadow that froze the soul. And at the edge of the world, he found it — a throne of obsidian, and upon it, the Shadow King himself.</p>

<p>“You carry what is mine,” the King’s voice thundered. “Return the sun, boy, and I may spare your breath.”</p>

<p>Cael’s heart pounded. “You stole it from everyone. You don’t deserve its light.”</p>

<p>The King smiled, slow and cruel. “Light is wasted on those who cannot bear its truth.”</p>

<p>The King rose, darkness coiling around him like smoke. “Then let the night have you.”</p>

<p>The lantern trembled in Cael’s hand. He remembered the warmth, the whisper, the promise. The voice spoke again inside him:</p>

<p><em>“Break the glass.”</em></p>

<p>“What will happen?” Cael whispered.</p>

<p><em>“The dawn will return... but you will not.”</em></p>

<p>He hesitated. To die for light — was that madness, or meaning?</p>

<p>The Shadow King’s shadow lunged. Cael closed his eyes and smashed the lantern upon the stone.</p>

<hr>

<p>Light exploded outward — pure, golden, endless. It swept across the land like a tide, burning through centuries of night. The Shadow King screamed, dissolving into the brilliance. The Vale melted, mountains wept, and the sky cracked open to reveal a dawn unseen for generations.</p>

<p>And in that light, Cael smiled once — before he became part of it.</p>

<hr>

<p>When the sun rose over Aeloria for the first time in two hundred years, the people wept. They found a broken lantern at the edge of the Vale, and within it — a single feather of flame still glowing faintly.</p>

<p>They built a shrine there, and called it the <em>Resting Place of the First Dawnbearer</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Lantern of Aeloria</em> is a story of sacrifice and hope — a reminder that even in endless darkness, light survives through those brave enough to carry it. Sometimes, the smallest spark can awaken a forgotten world. ✨</p>
