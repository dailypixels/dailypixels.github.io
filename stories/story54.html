      <p>
        On Willow Street stood an abandoned townhouse,  
        its windows boarded and its paint faded gray.  
        Neighbors whispered that no one had entered in twenty years.  
        Yet every night at 11:00 sharp,  
        a faint light flickered through a crack beneath the attic door.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Detective Harris had seen many strange cases,  
        but this one clung to him.  
        He forced the lock and stepped inside.  
        Dust floated in the air,  
        the silence broken only by the creak of the floorboards.  
      </p>

      <p>
        At the top of the stairs,  
        the attic door was bolted from the outside.  
        Strange—why lock something in, not out?  
      </p>

      <p>
        With a deep breath, he slid the bolt and opened it.  
        Inside, the room was nearly empty—  
        except for a small table,  
        a single candle burning,  
        and a diary lying open as if someone had just left.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The last entry was dated that very morning.  
        “If anyone finds this, know that I never left.  
        The house keeps me here. Don’t stay past midnight.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        The candle sputtered.  
        Behind him, the door slammed shut.  
        Harris lunged at it, but the lock clicked back into place.  
        The house had claimed him,  
        just as it had all the others before.
