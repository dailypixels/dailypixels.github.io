        Every morning, Lila wakes before dawn. She brews coffee, opens the window, and watches the city slowly stretch awake. The smell of bread from the bakery across the street drifts through the air, mingling with the crisp scent of morning dew.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, she notices the old man feeding pigeons on the corner. He smiles at her; she smiles back. Small interactions, fleeting, yet comforting. Life is stitched together in these tiny, unnoticed moments.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time the sun fully rises, Lila has written two pages in her journal, watered the plants, and greeted each neighbor she passes. The world is not perfect, but in this morning light, it feels manageable, beautiful even.
