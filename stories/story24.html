      <p>
        The bus stop bench was cold against her back. Maya pulled her coat tighter and watched the empty street stretch into the darkness. 
        It was almost midnight, and she was tired—tired in a way that wasn’t just about the long shift she’d worked, but about life itself. 
        The kind of tired that makes you question everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        The store where she worked had cut her hours again. Rent was still due, groceries still cost money, and her phone buzzed every 
        few minutes with another bill reminder. She’d skipped dinner to save a few dollars, but her stomach growled anyway. 
        A flickering streetlight overhead hummed like it was mocking her exhaustion.
      </p>

      <p>
        A man sat down beside her, his clothes rough and weathered. He carried a plastic bag full of cans. “Bus running late?” he asked, 
        his voice soft, as though he already knew the answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maya nodded. “Yeah. Last one tonight.”  
        He chuckled. “Figures. Everything important in this city is always late.”  
        There was no bitterness in his tone, just a quiet resignation she recognized. 
        They sat in silence for a while, both staring at the empty road like it might suddenly deliver something better than a bus.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Rough day?” he asked after a moment.  
        She hesitated. “Yeah. Feels like… every day’s been rough lately.”  
        He smiled, a tired smile but genuine. “I get that. But you’re here. Still waiting for the bus. That counts for something.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        She turned to him, curious. “What do you mean?”  
        “Means you haven’t given up yet. Lotta folks stop showing up, stop waiting. But you’re here. That’s strength, whether you feel it or not.”
      </p>

      <p>
        His words lingered as headlights finally cut through the darkness. The bus groaned to a stop, its doors opening with a hiss.  
        Maya reached into her pocket for change, only to find she was short. She froze, panic rising.  
        Without a word, the man slipped a few coins into her palm. “Go on,” he said.  
      </p>

      <p>
        She tried to protest, but he waved her off. “I’ll catch the next one. Go get some rest.”  
        Her throat tightened as she stepped onto the bus, glancing back at him sitting alone under that flickering light. 
        The driver closed the door, and the bus pulled away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maya leaned her head against the cold glass window, watching the man shrink into the distance. 
        For the first time in weeks, she felt something stir in her chest—a quiet hope.  
        Maybe tomorrow would be just as hard. Maybe harder.  
        But she’d wait for the bus. She’d keep showing up. Because sometimes, that’s all it takes to keep moving forward.
