     <p> The first time she heard him play, it was autumn. <br><br> The air smelled of rain and rusted leaves, and the park was half-empty except for a man with a violin beneath the oak tree. His music wasn’t flawless — a few trembling notes, a missed rhythm — yet something in it carried warmth, like a whisper from a life she hadn’t lived yet. <br> She stayed until his song ended. Then she clapped, softly. He looked up, surprised, as if applause was a language he had forgotten. <br> “Do you always play alone?” she asked. <br> “Only until someone listens,” he said. </p> <p> Her name was <em>Elara</em>. His was <em>Jonas</em>. And from that day, the park became their meeting place — every Sunday, at the same hour, beneath the same tree. He would play; she would listen. Sometimes she’d hum along, and the melody would catch the light between them like dust caught in sunlight. <br> They never said what they were to each other — not love, not friendship, just something that didn’t need naming. </p> <p> One evening, as twilight crept through the branches, he said quietly, “I’m writing something new — for you. The last song of autumn.” <br> She smiled. “Then don’t finish it too soon.” <br> He laughed, but his eyes didn’t. “I’ll try.” </p> <p> Weeks passed. The leaves turned gold, then brown. Each time they met, his playing grew slower — softer — as though each note was a heartbeat running out of time. <br> She noticed his hands trembling, his breath short, but she didn’t ask. Some silences, she knew, were too fragile to break. </p> <p> One Sunday, he didn’t come. <br> The bench was empty. The violin case was gone. Only the wind played through the oak leaves, making them sound like strings. She waited until the streetlights blinked on, until the cold crept through her coat, until it felt like waiting itself had become a kind of prayer. </p> <p> Two days later, she received a small envelope with no return address. Inside was a folded sheet of music — unfinished, with the final line missing. And beneath the notes, a message in his handwriting: <br> <em>“If I can’t play it for you, promise me you’ll listen to the wind. It knows the ending.”</em> </p> <p> That winter, she went back to the park alone. Snow covered the benches, the trees bare and skeletal. She sat beneath the same oak, humming his song softly — the one without an ending. <br> And just as her voice began to fade, a gust of wind swept through the branches, carrying a low, trembling hum that completed the melody. <br> She closed her eyes, tears freezing against her cheeks. He had kept his promise — one last song before the leaves fell. </p> <p> Every year after, when autumn returned, so did she. She’d sit beneath the oak tree, humming that song. And sometimes, when the light was right and the wind came from the east, the air would echo faintly — as if another violin was answering. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Last Song of Autumn* is about love that doesn’t vanish — it transforms. Some stories don’t end when someone leaves; they linger in the spaces between sound and silence. True love, like music, never dies — it just changes instruments. 🎻🍂 </p>
