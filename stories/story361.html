      <p>
        Meera had always dreamt of flying—literally. Not in planes, but soaring freely, feeling the wind lift her worries, her doubts. But life had anchored her: family responsibilities, financial struggles, and an endless barrage of “you can’t.”
      </p>

      <p>
        One summer morning, she decided to face the cliff near her hometown. Paragliders skimmed the skies above. Her heart thundered in her chest. Every fiber screamed to retreat. Yet, she reminded herself: courage was not the absence of fear—it was moving forward despite it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step by step, she prepared. Harness secured, glider ready. A deep breath, eyes closed, and then she ran. The wind caught her, lifting her higher, and for the first time in years, Meera felt limitless. Below, the world continued, but up here, it was hers alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        She landed safely, breathless and smiling. That day, she understood: dreams are not about escaping life—they are about expanding it. The wings of tomorrow are built by the courage we summon today.
