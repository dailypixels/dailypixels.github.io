      <p>
        The sea had grown louder over the years. Waves crashed harder, winds howled longer, and storms came without warning. Still, the lighthouse stood. Its stones had been worn by salt and time, but its lantern never failed to cut through the fog.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ewan, the keeper, had lived there for decades. His days were simple: polish the glass, wind the mechanism, log the weather, wait. Ships used to pass often — their horns echoing gratitude as beams of light guided them safely through the cliffs. But shipping routes changed, and fewer vessels came this way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes months passed without a single sail. Still, Ewan lit the lamp each evening as the sun fell. "Not for me to decide who needs it," he muttered, striking the match. "Only for me to keep it burning."
      </p>

      <p>
        One night, a storm unlike any he had seen raged. Thunder shook the ground, and the sea roared like a beast in pain. Through sheets of rain, Ewan saw a small fishing boat struggling against the waves. He steadied the light, adjusting its angle so it pierced the darkest stretch of water.
      </p>

      <p>
       Hours later, soaked and exhausted, Ewan watched the boat crawl into the safety of the harbor. No one knew his name, but someone’s life had been pulled back from the sea because a single light had not been allowed to die.
      </p>

<p>The storm passed, and the keeper returned to his chair. The sea would keep changing, but as long as the lighthouse stood, he would be there. Because sometimes hope is not knowing if anyone is watching — but shining anyway.</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>The story reminds us that small acts of faith and consistency matter, even when unseen. Like the lighthouse, our efforts may go unnoticed for years, until one day they become the difference between loss and survival.</p>
