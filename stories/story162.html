     <p><strong>Part I: The Empty Stage</strong></p>

<p>The old Orpheum Theater smelled of velvet, dust, and memory. Julian Rivers stood at center stage, his reflection shimmering faintly in the polished floorboards. Outside, the city hummed — indifferent to the man who once made it weep.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night was his farewell performance. Fifty years of acting, fifty years of applause, and yet he felt hollow. The play was <em>King Lear</em> — fitting, he thought, since he too had grown old and foolish.</p>

<p>He looked out at the empty seats, whispering lines to the shadows. “Pray you, undo this button…” The echo came back to him, soft and sad. He could almost hear the audience that once roared his name. But fame, like theater lights, always fades when the curtain falls.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part II: The Ghost in the Balcony</strong></p>

<p>That night, Julian stayed late in the theater. As he rehearsed alone, he noticed movement in the balcony — a figure, barely visible in the dim light. “Who's there?” he called. Silence.</p>

<p>He climbed the creaking stairs and found a young woman sitting in the front row, gazing at the stage. She looked familiar — her eyes bright, her expression full of admiration.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “I didn’t mean to intrude. I just… I grew up watching you here.”</p>

<p>Julian smiled faintly. “Then you’re one of the last. They don’t come for plays anymore — only screens and noise.”</p>

<p>“They’ll come for you,” she replied. “They always do.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled with something like sadness. When he blinked, she was gone.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part III: The Final Rehearsal</strong></p>

<p>The next day, Julian’s director begged him to rest. His health had been failing — a weak heart, a trembling hand — but Julian refused. “Actors don’t rest,” he said. “We just wait for our cue.”</p>

<p>As he stepped onto the stage for rehearsal, a familiar unease settled over him. He kept glancing toward the balcony, half-expecting the girl to return. Every line he spoke felt heavier than the last, as if each word carried the weight of all the roles he had never played, all the lives he had pretended to live.</p>

<p>When rehearsal ended, he found a single white rose placed at center stage. No one admitted to leaving it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Last Performance</strong></p>

<p>The night of the show, the theater filled to the brim. Old faces, critics, admirers — all gathered to witness the legend’s final act. The lights dimmed, and Julian stepped into his final role.</p>

<p>Every word, every gesture, was fire. He became Lear, the fallen king, broken by pride and love. When he reached his last monologue, the world outside ceased to exist.</p>

<p>“Pray you, undo this button…” he whispered, clutching his chest. The audience leaned forward, breathless. Then came silence — real, pure, endless. The curtain fell slowly as he sank to his knees.</p>

<p>When they lifted it again, Julian Rivers was gone — a faint smile still lingering on his face.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part V: The Letter</strong></p>

<p>After the performance, the stage manager found an envelope on Julian’s dressing table. It read:</p>

<p><em>“To those who stayed until the end — thank you. All I ever wanted was to make you feel something real. If I’ve done that, even once, then I’ve lived well. Every actor leaves the stage eventually… but the story, if told right, never dies.”</em></p>

<p>Beside it lay a single white rose.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Curtain Call</em> is a reflection on legacy, passion, and the fleeting nature of art. It reminds us that the truest success is not applause, but the moments we touch another soul. Some people die with silence — others with a standing ovation. 🎭🌹</p>
