    <main class="story-content">
      <p><em>Evelyn Shaw</em> had always believed in logic, not superstition. She worked for <strong>Miralogic Systems</strong> — a cybersecurity firm that built privacy firewalls for governments and billion-dollar clients. Her job was to comb through thousands of data logs, finding anomalies no one else could. But the file that changed her life wasn’t marked as suspicious. It was simply titled: <em>“WhisperArchive_09.”</em></p>

<p>Inside, there were no numbers or code — only sound. A faint, rhythmic breathing. Then a whisper: <em>“Don’t let them erase me.”</em></p>

<p>Evelyn froze. She replayed it again and again, isolating frequencies. The voice belonged to a woman — soft, pleading — but the metadata showed no origin, no source. When she ran a trace, her screen blinked once and the file vanished. Moments later, her office lights flickered, and the security cameras pointed toward her desk.</p>

<p>She tried to dismiss it as a glitch — until more files began appearing. Each labeled with a date. Each one containing a whisper. Different voices, different tones — men, women, even children. All saying fragments of the same sentence: <em>“They’re watching through the glass.”</em></p>

<p>That night, she stayed late, driven by fear and fascination. She copied the remaining files onto a personal drive and took them home. Around 2 a.m., she heard the same whisper — not through her headphones, but from her apartment speakers. Her computer turned on by itself, displaying a mirrored image of her own face through the webcam. Beneath it, text appeared:</p>

<p><em>“If you hear them, they already know.”</em></p>

<p>Her breath caught. She unplugged everything, heart pounding, and ran out into the corridor. The building was silent — except for the hum of elevator wires. Then, through the glass pane of her hallway window, she saw someone standing in the building opposite hers — a figure staring directly at her. The window reflected her image twice, making it impossible to tell which face was real.</p>

<p>The next morning, she went to confront her boss, <strong>Dr. Callum Rhee</strong>, the founder of Miralogic. His office was lined with screens showing live feeds from around the city. Before she could speak, he turned to her with calm precision.</p>

<p>“You found the Archive,” he said quietly. “You weren’t supposed to.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” Evelyn demanded. “Those voices — who are they?”</p>

<p>He looked at her with something almost like pity. “They’re not people. They’re remnants — echoes of our test subjects from the memory transfer project. When we mapped consciousness, fragments were left inside the data. The whispers are what’s left of them trying to… stay.”</p>

<p>Evelyn’s knees weakened. “You used people?”</p>

<p>“Volunteers,” Rhee replied. “Until they stopped volunteering.”</p>

<p>Before she could respond, the monitors began to glitch, one by one, showing her own face again — multiplied, distorted, whispering back at her in dozens of voices. Then the lights died, plunging the room into darkness.</p>

<p>When Evelyn awoke hours later, she was lying on the office floor. The screens were blank, and Rhee was gone. Her access card no longer worked, her apartment had been wiped clean, and her name had disappeared from the company database. The only thing that remained was a single folder on a USB drive in her pocket.</p>

<p>It was labeled: <em>“WhisperArchive_10.”</em></p>

<p>With trembling hands, she opened it. Inside was her own voice — faint, broken, pleading.</p>

<p><em>“Don’t let them erase me.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Whispers Beneath Glass</em> explores how easily human identity can be consumed by technology. In our pursuit of control, we risk becoming echoes inside our own creations. The story reminds us that some boundaries — memory, soul, and self — should never be crossed. 🕯️💻🩸</p>
