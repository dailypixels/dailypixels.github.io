      <p>
        Mia and Jordan had always been there for each other, through heartbreaks, career struggles, and moments of doubt.  
        On the eve of a major life change for Mia, Jordan suggested they revisit their favorite hilltop, carrying lanterns they had decorated years ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the sun set, the friends lit the lanterns one by one, each flame representing a challenge they had overcome and the dreams they still held.  
        Together, they released the lanterns into the sky, watching them drift higher, illuminating the night like tiny beacons of hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jordan spoke softly, “Even when life feels dark, we can be the light for each other.”  
        Mia smiled, feeling warmth not only from the lanterns but from the unwavering bond they shared.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, they talked about the future, shared fears, and laughed over old memories.  
        The simple act of lighting lanterns reminded them that friendship, like light, grows stronger when shared and carried forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walking down the hill under a canopy of stars, Mia and Jordan realized that the best support comes from someone who reminds you that no darkness is too great when hearts stand together.
