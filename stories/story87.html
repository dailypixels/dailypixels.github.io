      <p>
        Maya and Ethan had grown apart after college,  
        each chasing dreams in different cities.  
        Though years passed, they still shared a bond that distance couldn’t erase.  
        Every night, Maya looked at the stars, imagining Ethan doing the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        A sudden decision brought Maya back to their hometown for the holidays.  
        As she walked through the familiar streets, memories of laughter, shared secrets,  
        and first love flooded back. And there he was—Ethan, waiting by the old rooftop,  
        where they had spent countless nights talking about life and the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Words weren’t necessary at first. They sat side by side,  
        feeling the years dissolve into silence, the stars witnessing their quiet reunion.  
        Ethan finally spoke, “I never stopped thinking about you.”  
        Maya smiled, “Neither did I.”
      </p>

      <p>
        They spent the evening reminiscing, laughing, and sharing the paths their lives had taken.  
        It was clear that time and distance had only strengthened their connection.  
        Under the same sky they had gazed upon years ago,  
        they found their hearts beating in unison again.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the first light of dawn painted the city in gold,  
        Maya and Ethan held hands, knowing some love stories are timeless,  
        and some reunions are meant to be,  
        reminding them that the heart always remembers its home.
