      <p>
        Deep in the forest where no path dared to stay, a lantern flickered. Villagers whispered of it for centuries—the Lantern of Whispering Souls, a relic said to capture the voices of those who died unheard.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one dared to seek it, except Laila.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was a girl with no surname, orphaned by fire and silence, known only as “the foundling.” Her heart ached with a question no one answered: Who had she been before the flames?
      </p>

      <p>
        One twilight, drawn by instinct more than courage, she entered the forest. The mist clung to her skin, trees loomed like watchful giants, and then—there it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lantern hung from a low branch, glowing faintly as though waiting. She reached for it. The air trembled. And then—voices.
      </p>
      <p>
        They rose, not in screams, but in whispers. Gentle, sorrowful, forgotten words filled her ears: prayers left unfinished, songs cut short, names no one spoke anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        And within them, a voice she somehow knew. Soft, broken, calling her name. Laila.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her knees buckled. She saw flashes: a mother’s hand, a father’s laughter, a small home by the river. Her past returned not in full, but in fragments stitched by love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lantern’s glow dimmed, its whispers fading. She clutched it tight.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Will they vanish forever?” she asked aloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        A final whisper answered: Not if you carry us.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she returned to her village, not with despair, but with purpose. She became a storyteller, weaving voices into tales, ensuring that none would be forgotten again. The Lantern of Whispering Souls never glowed after that night—but its light lived in her words.
      </p>

        Meaning / Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        This story shows that even in loss, we can become vessels for memory. The forgotten are only truly gone when no one speaks their names—Laila’s gift reminds us that <b>to remember is to keep souls alive</b>.
