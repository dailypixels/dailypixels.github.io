        Every evening, Emma walked to the old riverside bench. It had been her and Daniel’s place since they were teenagers. Years ago, when Daniel left for the army, they promised to write letters. And they did—hundreds of them, tied neatly in a ribboned stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        The letters carried their laughter, fears, and whispered confessions. Through distance and silence, they stayed connected. But one day, the letters stopped. News followed: Daniel had been lost in battle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, Emma still returned to the bench, holding the letters like fragile treasures. On a quiet June evening, as the sun painted the river gold, a man limped toward her. It was Daniel—scarred, older, but alive. He had been missing, not gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Emma dropped the letters, rushing into his arms. The river carried their tears, the bench their laughter, and the letters—once symbols of longing—became the foundation of a love stronger than absence.
