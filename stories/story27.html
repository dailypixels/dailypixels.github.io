      <p>
        The attic smelled of cedar and time. I hadn’t been up here since I was a kid, but now, standing in the fading light 
        of a summer evening, it felt like stepping back into someone else’s life. Boxes towered like forgotten monuments. 
        Old toys, yellowed newspapers, photo albums—all of it frozen in dust and silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was cleaning out the house after my father’s passing, a task I’d been putting off for months. The house felt 
        heavier without him in it. Every room seemed to whisper, and the attic was the loudest of all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Near the far wall, under a moth-eaten quilt, I found a wooden box. It wasn’t like the others; this one was carved 
        with delicate vines and initials: *E.R.* My father’s initials. The lock was rusted but snapped easily. 
        Inside, nestled among brittle letters tied with string, was one envelope addressed not to my mother, but to me.  
        The handwriting was unmistakable—his. The date was last year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hands trembling, I opened it.  
        <em>“If you’re reading this, it means I couldn’t tell you in person. There are things about our family I should have 
        said long ago.”</em>  
        My throat tightened as I read. He spoke of sacrifices, regrets, of a secret he’d carried for decades:  
        my real mother had died when I was a baby, and the woman I’d called “Mom” all my life was his sister.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The attic spun. All those years of strained conversations, the coldness in her hugs—it all made sense now.  
        I wanted to be angry, but instead I felt hollow. My father had carried this truth to his grave, and I was left 
        holding the shards of a family I thought I knew.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I set the letter down, a photograph slipped out from between the pages. A young woman with my eyes, 
        holding me as a baby. She was smiling. The picture was creased from being folded over and over again.  
        On the back, in his handwriting: *“For her to know one day.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        I sat there in the attic until night fell, the hum of cicadas outside fading into silence.  
        The letter didn’t offer closure—just more questions. But as I looked at the photograph, 
        I realized my father had loved me enough to protect me from a truth he thought would hurt.  
        And maybe, in some way, that was love, too.
