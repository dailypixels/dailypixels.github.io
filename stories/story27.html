    <main class="story-content">
     <p> It was supposed to be a routine trip. The *Midnight Express* from Blackridge to Devon ran every Friday, without fail. But that night, the train stopped where it shouldn’t have — a nameless platform swallowed by fog. <br><br> At first, no one noticed. The passengers — a soldier, a nurse, a businessman, a teenage girl, and an old violinist — were half asleep or lost in their own worlds. Then, the conductor’s voice came through the intercom, trembling slightly: <br> “Ladies and gentlemen… we appear to have made an unscheduled stop. Please remain calm.” </p> <p> The soldier, Captain Rafiq, looked out the window. The station signs were blank — just metal boards with no writing. The air outside was still, heavy. <br> He saw movement on the platform — figures standing too still, faces hidden by mist. Watching. <br><br> “Why are we stopping here?” the nurse whispered. “This station isn’t on the map.” <br> The old violinist smiled faintly. “Perhaps we’re not on the map either anymore.” </p> <p> Minutes stretched into an hour. The lights inside the train began to flicker. Phones had no signal. The businessman tried to open the emergency door, but the handle wouldn’t budge. Then the train *shuddered* — a deep metallic groan that echoed down every carriage. <br><br> The intercom crackled again. <br> “Departure in five minutes. All who must leave… leave now.” </p> <p> No one moved. Until the teenage girl — Mira — pointed outside. <br> “My brother,” she said. “He’s out there.” <br><br> Everyone turned. A boy stood on the platform, pale and silent, waving her closer. Rafiq held her back, but the doors opened on their own. The air that entered wasn’t cold — it was *empty*, like a vacuum that swallowed sound. <br> Mira stepped out before anyone could stop her. </p> <p> The platform lights flared white — and when they faded, she and the boy were gone. The figures in the fog turned toward the train, and one of them — the conductor — was among them. <br> The *Midnight Express* began to move again, slowly, dragging itself forward. The remaining passengers sat in silence, the seats around them colder than before. <br> In the reflection of the windows, faces appeared — people who weren’t there. </p> <p> When the train reached Devon, only one person got off: the old violinist. He handed his ticket to the station master and said, “You’re still collecting these?” <br><br> The man frowned. “Sir, this ticket’s from 1973.” <br><br> The violinist smiled, tucked it back into his coat, and disappeared into the crowd. </p>

<h2>Meaning / Reflection:</h2>
<p>Last Stop Before Midnight is a journey through time, guilt, and unfinished goodbyes. It reminds us that not every destination can be found on a map — some are written in memory, waiting for closure. Sometimes, the scariest journeys are the ones we never meant to take, but needed to.</p>
