      <p>
        After a decade apart, Claire returned to her hometown to settle her grandmother’s estate. The familiar streets brought back memories of James, her first love and closest friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the attic, she discovered a stack of letters she had never opened, all written by James over the years. Each letter spoke of longing, regret, and hope that fate would bring them together again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Determined, Claire sought James at the café where they had first met. To her surprise, he was there, older but unmistakably him. Time melted away as they exchanged awkward smiles that quickly turned into laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sitting on a park bench beneath falling leaves, they read the letters aloud, sharing tears and smiles. Words once written in longing became bridges that reunited their hearts.
      </p>

      <p>
        James held Claire’s hand and whispered, “Some stories are meant to wait, but they always find their ending.”  
        Claire smiled, feeling the warmth of love rekindled and knowing that the years apart had only strengthened the bond they shared.
