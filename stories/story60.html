      <p>
        Hollow Street was the kind of road people avoided after sunset.  
        Overgrown trees leaned into the cracked pavement,  
        their branches whispering against one another like secrets.  
        But at the very end of the street stood the house—  
        a tall, rotting structure with broken shutters,  
        black windows, and a door that never seemed to stay shut.  
      </p>

      <p>
        For decades, no one had lived there.  
        The stories about the family who once owned it were endless—  
        some said they vanished overnight,  
        others swore they were buried beneath the cellar.  
        Yet every year, curious teenagers dared each other  
        to step inside.  
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, it was our turn.  
        Four of us—Jake, Lila, Marcus, and me.  
        Flashlights in hand, nerves rattling,  
        we crossed the threshold.  
        The smell hit first: damp wood, mold,  
        and something metallic that made my stomach turn.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “This place is falling apart,” Lila whispered,  
        her beam catching a staircase  
        that spiraled upward into darkness.  
        The walls were covered with peeling wallpaper,  
        and carved into the plaster  
        were words scratched so deep  
        they left grooves: <em>STAY OUT.</em>  
      </p>

      <p>
        The deeper we went, the colder it grew.  
        Our breaths fogged in front of us,  
        though it was early September.  
        From somewhere upstairs, a thud echoed—  
        deliberate, heavy, like a footstep.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “Probably raccoons,” Jake muttered,  
        though his voice shook.  
        We followed the sound,  
        climbing the staircase that groaned beneath our weight.  
        The hallway stretched unnaturally long,  
        doors lining each side,  
        every one slightly ajar.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Then Marcus froze.  
        “Do you hear that?” he whispered.  
        At first I didn’t.  
        But then it reached us—  
        the faint, distant sound of <em>laughter</em>.  
        High-pitched. Childlike.  
        Coming from behind the last door at the end of the hall.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’re leaving,” I hissed,  
        but Jake was already walking forward,  
        flashlight shaking in his hand.  
        He pushed open the door—  
        and revealed a bedroom frozen in time.  
        Toys scattered across the floor,  
        a rocking horse,  
        and on the wall,  
        four names written in red paint.  
        Ours.  
        Every one of our names.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The door slammed shut behind us.  
        The toys began to move on their own.  
        And from the closet,  
        the laughter turned into a voice—  
        low, guttural, echoing our names one by one.  
      </p>

      <p>
        We bolted.  
        Down the stairs, through the hall,  
        the house seemed to stretch and twist,  
        never letting us out.  
        The front door was gone,  
        replaced by endless walls.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t know how we escaped.  
        One moment we were trapped,  
        the next we were outside,  
        gasping for breath beneath the moonlight.  
        But the house wasn’t done with us.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning, Jake’s mother found his bed empty.  
        By the end of the week,  
        Marcus stopped answering calls.  
        And when I looked at my own wall that night,  
        there it was—  
        my name, carved deep into the plaster.
