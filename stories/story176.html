      <p>
        Maya and Ethan had shared dreams of summiting Crestfall Peak since college. Life’s responsibilities pulled them in different directions, but they promised to climb it together, no matter how long it took.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, Maya faced burnout at work, feeling overwhelmed by deadlines and pressure. A call from Ethan reminded her of their long-held promise. “The mountain is waiting,” he said, “and so is your strength.”
      </p>

      <p>
        They embarked on the climb, supporting each other with every step. When Maya faltered, Ethan encouraged her. When Ethan struggled, Maya guided him forward. Together, they conquered the peak, their laughter echoing across the valleys below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing at the summit, Maya realized that friendship was the greatest motivator, a force stronger than fear or fatigue. Ethan smiled, “We lift each other higher than we could ever climb alone.”  
        And in that shared victory, they understood that life’s mountains were meant to be faced together.
