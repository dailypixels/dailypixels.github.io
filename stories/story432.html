        Every evening, the railway bridge hummed as trains thundered overhead, carrying strangers to places beyond reach. Beneath it, three childhood friends carved their names into the stone wall—a promise that no matter where life pulled them, they would always return.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years passed. Life scattered them: one to a distant city, one to a foreign shore, and one left behind to keep the memories alive. When tragedy struck and the one who stayed was gone, the others returned, standing beneath the bridge once more. The names were still there, though weathered by rain and time.
      </p>
      <p>
        They traced the faded carvings with trembling hands, realizing that some bonds do not vanish with distance or death—they echo like the thunder of the trains, carrying their story forward.
