      <p>
        Everyone in Hollow Creek knew the stories about the red house on Ashmoor Lane. Children dared each other to touch its gate, teens whispered about screams in the night, and adults simply crossed the street when walking past.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Sam, Claire, and Jordan didn’t believe in ghost stories. On a cool March night, they broke the lock and slipped inside, laughing as dust swirled around their flashlights.
      </p>

      <p>
        The house smelled of rot and metal. Wallpaper peeled like dead skin, and every step echoed as though the house were hollow inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        “See? Nothing but an old dump,” Sam said.
      </p>
<p>
But then they noticed something strange. Every door they opened led back to the same hallway. No matter where they turned, they returned to the same spot: a long corridor lined with portraits of strangers whose eyes seemed to follow them.
</p>
<p>
Jordan shivered. “Guys… weren’t these faces different before?”
</p>
<p>
The portraits had changed. Now the paintings showed them — Sam, Claire, and Jordan — standing in the hallway, flashlights raised in terror.
</p>
<p>
The house groaned, and the lights flickered out.
</p>
<p>
In the pitch black, whispers seeped from the walls: “We’ve been waiting.”
</p>
<p>
Claire screamed as cold hands brushed her arm. Sam tried to run, but the floorboards stretched beneath his feet like tar, holding him in place. Jordan’s flashlight flickered back on, but the beam revealed only one thing: the portraits now showed three empty silhouettes, waiting to be filled.
</p>
<p>
The door slammed shut.
</p>
<p>
By morning, the house looked the same as ever — quiet, broken, abandoned. But if you pressed your ear to the door, you could still hear the faint echoes of three voices screaming from the walls.
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
Some places don’t just hold stories — they hunger for them. And those who mock the past may find themselves becoming part of it.
