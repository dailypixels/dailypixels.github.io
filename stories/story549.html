        Ethan walked into the interview room rehearsing his answers about spreadsheets, profits, and efficiency. What he didn’t expect was a final question from the panel: <em>“What kind of person do you want to become?”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The silence stretched. For the first time, Ethan admitted — to himself more than to the interviewers — that he didn’t just want a job; he wanted to matter, to lead with kindness, to build teams that trusted each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        He left unsure if he had secured the role, but certain he had found a compass. Weeks later, he received an offer. The company wasn’t hiring him for what he had memorized, but for the glimpse of authenticity he had revealed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The interview changed Ethan not because he got the job, but because it taught him the truest answers aren’t rehearsed — they are lived.
