        “Race you to the top!” Jake shouted, already sprinting ahead, his flashlight bouncing wildly in the dark.  
        I groaned, half-laughing, half-regretting agreeing to this midnight canyon hike. The air was warm and sticky, 
        cicadas humming their endless song as the rest of our group trailed behind, backpacks rattling with snacks and water bottles.

        “This is ridiculous,” Sarah whispered, gripping my arm as we scrambled over a boulder.  
        But her grin gave her away—she was loving it too. There’s something about being out past midnight that makes you feel 
        like a kid again, like the rules of the world don’t quite apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        We finally reached a small clearing where the canyon opened up under a wide stretch of stars.  
        And that’s when we saw them.  
        Fireflies. Dozens, maybe hundreds, glowing like tiny lanterns weaving through the trees.  
        “Whoa,” Jake said, for once actually quiet. The light show was mesmerizing, like the forest itself was breathing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without thinking, we all dropped our bags and started running. Laughing, stumbling, chasing those little bursts of magic 
        through the canyon. The fireflies darted and danced, always just out of reach, while our laughter echoed off the canyon walls.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ended up lying on our backs in the grass, breathless and sweaty, staring at the sky.  
        “Worth it,” Sarah said, breaking the comfortable silence. Jake chuckled, tossing a pebble into the darkness.  
        “Definitely worth it,” I agreed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We stayed there for hours, trading stories and making wishes on every shooting star we spotted.  
        There was no phone service, no responsibilities—just friends, laughter, and the hum of the summer night.  
        By the time we hiked back down, the first hints of dawn were coloring the sky.  
        We were exhausted, scratched up, and starving. And somehow, we’d never felt more alive.
