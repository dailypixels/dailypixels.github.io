        The crowd gasped when Sarah tripped on the track. Athletes blurred past as she sprawled on the ground, palms burning, knees scraped raw. Her medal hopes were gone.  
      </p>
      <p>
        She could’ve stayed there, listening to the roar fade. But something inside her whispered: <em>Get up.</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        She rose, limping, and kept running. By the time she crossed the finish line, last place, the stadium was thunderous—not for the winners, but for her.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Sarah didn’t win a medal. She won something greater—the knowledge that falling doesn’t define you, rising does.
