      <p>
        Sarah and Naomi had been inseparable since high school.  
        Life pulled them in different directions—career moves, family responsibilities,  
        and miles of separation—but their bond never weakened.  
        Every week, they promised to call, to check in, and to support each other no matter what.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, Naomi faced a major setback at work that left her feeling defeated.  
        Without hesitation, Sarah dropped everything and traveled to her side,  
        arriving with snacks, laughter, and encouragement.  
        They spent hours talking, walking, and reflecting on all the challenges they had overcome together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired by the moment, they decided to take on a new adventure—  
        hiking a mountain trail neither had tried before.  
        Step by step, they encouraged each other, laughing at missteps, celebrating each milestone.  
        By the time they reached the summit, breathless and elated,  
        they realized that friendship is not just comfort—it’s the courage to face life’s heights together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing on the peak, looking out at the horizon, Sarah said,  
        “No matter where life takes us, we always find our way back.”  
        Naomi smiled, “And we lift each other higher every time.”  
        In that moment, they understood that true friendship is the ultimate journey,  
        and every step taken together strengthens the bond that time can never break.
