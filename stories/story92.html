    <main class="story-content">
      <p> The advertisement called it “a sanctuary above the city.” Glass walls, modern furniture, an unbeatable view — Apartment 39B of the *Lucent Residences*. For <em>Eva Maren</em>, it was a new beginning. After her divorce and a quiet breakdown that no one spoke about, she wanted silence, air, and light. </p>

<p> The first week felt like freedom. She wrote again, cooked again, even laughed sometimes. At night, she’d stand by the panoramic window and watch the traffic below — a thousand stories moving, none of them hers. </p>

<p> But on the eighth night, she noticed something strange. Her reflection in the glass didn’t move when she did. For a heartbeat, it lagged behind — staring, almost aware. </p>

<p> She told herself it was exhaustion. That evening, she closed the curtains and went to bed. But at 2:13 a.m., the apartment’s intercom buzzed. She froze. No one should know her number yet. </p>

<p> “Eva,” a voice whispered through static. “Don’t close the curtains.” </p>

<p> Her skin went cold. The next morning, she told the building manager. He smiled politely, said the intercom must’ve glitched. “You’re our only resident on 39,” he added. “No one else could’ve called you.” </p>

<p> That night, she left the curtains open. The city lights reflected back at her — comforting, at first. Then she noticed a faint shimmer across the glass, a distortion, like heat waves. When she leaned closer, words appeared, fogging from the inside of the pane: <em>“We see you.”</em> </p>

<p> Her breath hitched. She grabbed her phone, recording the surface — but when she replayed the footage, the message was gone. </p>

<p> Over the next few days, small things shifted. Her coffee mug appeared in different spots. Her computer’s camera light blinked even when it was unplugged. She began covering mirrors, sleeping with lights on. She even thought about leaving — until the building manager told her the lease had no early exit clause. “You signed for one year,” he said cheerfully. “You’re safe here.” </p>

<p> Safe. The word felt wrong. </p>

<p> One stormy evening, while searching for her charger, Eva found a panel behind the wardrobe slightly ajar. Inside was a tiny black lens. A camera. Wired directly into the wall. She followed the cable with shaking hands — it led to another hidden compartment beneath the floorboards. There, an entire console blinked softly, labeled *39B / Behavioral Feed – Active.* </p>

<p> A video window showed her sitting on the bed — *live.* </p>

<p> She spun around, heart hammering. But she wasn’t on the bed. The feed was delayed by seconds, just like the reflection. </p>

<p> Then the intercom buzzed again. </p>

<p> “You weren’t supposed to find that,” the same voice said, calm now. “Please sit down, Eva.” </p>

<p> “Who are you?” she shouted, backing away. </p>

<p> “A researcher. You agreed to the observation. Check your lease.” </p>

<p> Her hands trembled as she flipped through the papers on the counter — and there, buried in fine print, it read: <em>‘Tenant consents to full behavioral study under the Lucent Cognitive Observation Project.’</em> </p>

<p> “I never signed up for this!” she screamed. </p>

<p> “You did,” the voice replied. “After the divorce, after the hospital, you signed a program form. You needed help, remember? We’ve only been watching your healing.” </p>

<p> “Liar,” she hissed, tearing at the cords, pulling the plugs. The screens went dark — except one. A mirror-like monitor flickered to life, showing not her, but a woman standing behind her reflection. She turned instantly, but the room was empty. </p>

<p> “We are always here,” the voice whispered again. “Even when you think you’re alone.” </p>

<p> The lights shut off. The city outside vanished into blackout. And in the darkness, the glass walls glowed faintly, showing hundreds of eyes watching from the inside. </p>

<p> When the authorities arrived days later, Apartment 39B was spotless — furniture gone, walls bare. The only thing they found was a single note written on the inside of the glass: <em>“She finally turned off the light.”</em> </p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
*The Glass Apartment* explores the illusion of privacy in a hyperconnected world — where surveillance hides behind comfort, and trust erodes in silence. It reminds us that sometimes what we think is safety is just a cage made of light. 🩸🏙️ </p>
