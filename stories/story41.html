      <p>
        Mondays are hard. But this Monday was out to destroy me.  
        I had one goal: grab a latte before work. Simple, right? Wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        The coffee shop was packed, the line snaking past the pastry case.  
        I finally ordered, juggling my phone, wallet, and an alarming sense of déjà vu  
        that I’d drop something. My name was called. Success!  
        Or so I thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I reached for the cup, my elbow clipped a tray of muffins.  
        The muffins toppled like slow-motion dominoes, and in my panic to catch them,  
        I flung my coffee straight into the air.  
        It landed—miraculously—on the counter. Upside down. Lid off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone froze. A barista gasped. I muttered an apology while  
        mopping up what was now a caramel-scented crime scene.  
        The guy behind me chuckled. “First day of the week, huh?”  
        I laughed, because crying felt too dramatic.
      </p>

      <p>
        The staff, saints that they are, remade my drink for free.  
        I slunk out of there, muffin crumbs in my bag and pride on the floor.  
        At least now I had a story for the office—and a reputation as  
        *‘the latte launcher.’*
