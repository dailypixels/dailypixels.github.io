     <p> When **Rayan** stepped off the bus, the air smelled of sugar, smoke, and rain. The town of **Namalpur** was alive with color — paper lanterns strung between old balconies, music spilling from narrow streets, and the river glowing under the reflection of hundreds of tiny lights. </p> <p> He hadn’t been here in ten years. The last time, his grandmother had held his hand and told him that every lantern carried a soul — “Some for the living,” she had said, “and some for those who still visit in dreams.” </p> <p> Now, she was gone. And yet, the moment he walked into the square, he swore he could hear her voice in the laughter of children. He followed the sound to the old temple steps, where people were lighting candles and whispering names into the wind. </p> <p> A little girl tugged at his sleeve. “Mister, will you help me light one?” she asked, holding out a crumpled paper lantern. He knelt and struck a match, watching the flame bloom softly like a memory returning. The girl smiled. “Who are you sending it for?” Rayan hesitated. “Someone who taught me how to see light.” </p> <p> As the lantern lifted into the sky, he saw hundreds of others rising — each one carrying whispers, wishes, apologies. And then he saw her — his grandmother — standing across the river, bathed in the glow of floating lanterns. She smiled, raised her hand gently, and the wind carried her voice — “Now you understand, my child. Light doesn’t leave. It only travels.” </p> <p> When the morning came, the streets were quiet, the lanterns gone. But Rayan felt a strange warmth — like someone had quietly relit the candle inside him. </p> <p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> “The Lanterns of Old Town” speaks of cultural memory — how traditions keep love, loss, and belonging alive through generations. We may leave the towns of our birth, but the festivals of light remind us — the stories we come from never stop glowing. ✨ </p>
