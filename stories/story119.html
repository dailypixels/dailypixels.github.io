    <main class="story-content">
      <p>The bench hadn’t changed much in thirty years.</p>

<p>Its paint was peeling, the wood rough with age, but to <strong>Daniel</strong>, it was the most familiar place in the world. Every summer of his childhood had been spent here — skipping stones, trading secrets, dreaming of a future that always felt too far away. And beside him, back then and always, had been <strong>Leo</strong>.</p>

<p>Now Daniel sat alone, holding a letter he’d never planned to send.</p>

<p>Leo had moved away right after high school. At first, they’d written to each other every week. Then once a month. Then… silence. Life, as it often does, had pulled them into separate currents. Daniel had gone into teaching; Leo, last he’d heard, had joined the Navy.</p>

<p>But the letter in Daniel’s pocket wasn’t about the past. It was an apology. For all the birthdays missed, the words unsaid, the time wasted.</p>

<p>He was about to leave when he heard a familiar voice behind him: “You still throw like a wounded duck?”</p>

<p>Daniel turned — and there he was. Older, yes. His hair was thinner, his face weathered, but his grin was exactly the same. Leo stood holding two cups of coffee, as if no time at all had passed.</p>

<p>Daniel laughed in disbelief. “You’re supposed to be in California!”</p>

<p>Leo shrugged. “Was. Got tired of sunshine. Missed the mud.” He nodded toward the bench. “You still come here, huh?”</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a while, the river whispering around them. Then Daniel pulled the letter from his pocket and handed it over.</p>

<p>Leo read it quietly. When he finished, he folded it neatly and slipped it back. “You don’t need to be sorry,” he said softly. “We just took different roads. But they still led back here.”</p>

<p>Daniel felt something loosen in his chest — a knot he hadn’t realized he’d been carrying all these years. They talked for hours, not about what they’d missed, but about what they still had. They laughed until the stars appeared, until the park lights flickered on and their coffee went cold.</p>

<p>When they finally stood to leave, Leo clapped Daniel on the shoulder. “Let’s not wait another thirty years, huh?”</p>

<p>Daniel smiled. “Not even thirty days.”</p>

<p>As they walked away, the bench by the river sat quiet under the moonlight — holding the echoes of two boys who had never really stopped being friends.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Bench by the River</em> reminds us that true friendship isn’t measured by time or distance. Even when life separates us, the bond remains — waiting patiently, like an old bench, for the day we return. Some connections never fade; they just wait for the right moment to begin again. 🌅🤝</p>
