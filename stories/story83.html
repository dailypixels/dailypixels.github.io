      <p>
        Claire had always cherished the letters she and Ethan exchanged in college,  
        a secret habit that bound them even when miles separated their lives.  
        But after graduation, life’s twists pulled them apart,  
        leaving the letters unread and the mailbox empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, Claire returned to the seaside town where they had met,  
        drawn by nostalgia and the hope that some things never truly fade.  
        She wandered to the old lighthouse, where the scent of saltwater  
        mingled with memories, and there he was—Ethan, older, wiser,  
        but with the same gentle eyes she remembered.
      </p>

      <p>
        They talked cautiously at first, hesitant, as if the years had built walls between them.  
        Then Ethan handed her a worn envelope. Inside were all the letters she had never received,  
        each one filled with his thoughts, dreams, and longing.  
        Tears blurred her vision as the weight of unspoken words melted away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I never stopped writing,” Ethan said softly.  
        Claire smiled, “And I never stopped waiting.”  
        The sun dipped low, painting the sky in gold, and in that light,  
        they embraced, realizing that true love survives distance, time, and silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, under the stars, they walked the beach hand in hand,  
        hearts aligned, knowing that some connections are timeless,  
        and some reunions are worth every year apart.
