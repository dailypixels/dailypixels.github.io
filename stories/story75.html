      <p> *Lena Rourke* moved into Apartment 3B on a gray November afternoon. The building was old — the kind with narrow hallways that smelled faintly of dust and rain. She wanted peace, a place to start over after a bad breakup. But peace wasn’t what she got. </p> <p> The first night, she heard footsteps above her — slow, deliberate, almost rhythmic. But the landlord had said the fourth floor was vacant. The next day, she asked the old woman in 3A about it. “Vacant?” the woman had whispered. “Not quite. Someone moved in last week. A quiet man. Keeps to himself.” </p> <p> Lena shrugged it off until she found the first envelope under her door. No name, no address — just a single photo inside. It was a picture of her, taken from across the street. The timestamp read *2:17 a.m.* She hadn’t even been outside that night. </p> <p> The next morning, she went to the landlord, but he only frowned. “There’s no tenant in 4C. That apartment’s been empty for years.” </p> <p> That night, she heard footsteps again — only this time, they stopped directly above her. Then a soft scrape, like furniture being moved. She stared at the ceiling, heart pounding. Suddenly, she remembered something — the hallway upstairs didn’t align perfectly with hers. The apartment above wasn’t *directly* overhead. It was slightly offset. Which meant… someone was moving *right above her bedroom wall.* </p> <p> She called the police, but by the time they arrived, the noises had stopped. They searched the upper floor and found the door to 4C locked from the inside. They broke it open. The apartment was empty. Dusty. No furniture, no lights — except a single thing on the floor: a camera stand, pointed through a hole in the wall that looked straight down into Lena’s apartment. </p> <p> The next morning, she packed her bags and left the building. But as she reached her car, a familiar envelope sat on her windshield. Inside was another photo — of her leaving the apartment — and written on the back, in faint pencil, were the words: <em>“You moved out too soon. The story wasn’t over.”</em> </p>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Apartment Across the Hall* explores how fear often begins where certainty ends. Sometimes the true terror isn’t what we can see — it’s what watches us silently from the edges of the ordinary. In every locked door and darkened window, there’s a story unfinished… and someone waiting for the next chapter. 🕯️🔑 </p>
