      <p>
        The night bus was nearly empty.  
        Only three passengers remained:  
        the driver, a young woman named Elise,  
        and a man who hadn’t moved since boarding.  
        He sat in the last row, head tilted down,  
        hands clasped together like he was praying.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elise tried not to look at him,  
        but the air was heavy, unnatural.  
        Streetlamps flickered past the windows,  
        yet his reflection never showed in the glass.  
        Her chest tightened.
      </p>

      <p>
        The driver hummed to the radio,  
        oblivious.  
        Elise finally gathered courage,  
        walked toward the man,  
        and whispered, “Sir? Are you okay?”  
        He didn’t answer.  
        He didn’t even breathe.
      </p>

      <p>
        She reached out—her fingers brushing his sleeve.  
        The fabric was ice-cold.  
        Slowly, the man’s head lifted,  
        revealing hollow eyes that seemed  
        carved from shadows themselves.  
        A smile spread across his face—  
        one too wide, too sharp to belong to any human.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Elise stumbled back, heart racing.  
        The driver finally looked into the mirror.  
        “Who are you talking to?” he asked.  
        Elise froze.  
        The last row of the bus was empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        She collapsed into her seat,  
        clutching her arms, shivering.  
        But when she glanced at the glass again,  
        the reflection of the man was there—  
        seated directly behind her.
