        Detective Mara found the envelope on her desk without a sender’s name. Inside were six photographs of a recent crime scene — but one was blank. The caption on the back read: <em>“The one you cannot see is the one who matters most.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Reviewing the case files, she realized the photograph was meant to show a suspect who had been in every witness statement but absent from every piece of evidence. Almost as though someone had erased him from history.
      </p>
      <p>
        That night, Mara dreamed of the blank photo filling with a man’s silhouette. When she awoke, she knew the truth: the suspect wasn’t missing. He had been deliberately written out — by someone within her own department.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blank photograph became her obsession, a reminder that what is missing can be louder than what remains. And somewhere, the erased man was waiting to be found.
