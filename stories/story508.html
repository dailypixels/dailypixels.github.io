        I arrived in Prague with nothing but a backpack, a half-folded map, and the desire to lose myself in its winding streets. The city was often called the "City of a Hundred Spires," but to me, it was the city of bridges. Each crossing of the Vltava River seemed to open another world—a shift in architecture, in language, in rhythm.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the first morning, I walked across the Charles Bridge before dawn. The statues loomed like guardians in the mist, while street musicians quietly tuned their violins waiting for the day’s first travelers. The bridge was more than stone; it was a storybook laid across water. Every step felt like a conversation with centuries past.
      </p>

        By noon, I had taken a wrong turn and ended up in a small neighborhood café, where the waitress spoke little English but offered me goulash with a smile. Around me, locals chatted in hushed voices, their laughter echoing off painted walls. I felt both foreign and strangely at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        The highlight came at night when the city glowed golden. Lights reflected off the river, and the bridges looked as if they floated on fire. I realized then that travel is not about reaching landmarks—it’s about those moments of awe that cannot be photographed, only carried in memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Getting lost in Prague was not a mistake; it was a reminder that sometimes the best journeys are those where the map doesn’t matter. What matters is what you allow yourself to feel when you wander.
