    <main class="story-content">
      <p>The lighthouse near Cliffton Bay used to be the brightest thing for miles.</p>

<p>Its white beam sliced the sea in slow, steady rotations, protecting passing ships from the jagged teeth of the coastline. Even neighbors who had lived here forever said its glow comforted them on sleepless nights, proof that light always returned.</p>

<p>That was before the Briar House.</p>

<p>Before the darkness learned to swallow.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Briar House was older than the cliff it sat on. The kind of house that looked stolen from a haunted novel. Built tight to the rock, its stilts sunk deep like roots belonging to something more alive than wood.</p>

<p>The newspaper headline called it a “Lucky Purchase.” The price was low, the location was oceanfront, and the family who bought it thought they had won life’s lottery. A perfect reset. Fresh career. Fresh start. Fresh air.</p>

<p>They arrived in late August: Henry and Mara Briar, their teenage daughter Lily, and her little brother Sam, age seven.</p>

<p>Local kids told stories first.</p>

<p>“My cousin’s dog went inside once. Never came back out.”</p>

<p>“Seagulls fly around it, but they never land.”</p>

<p>“It used to belong to a blind woman who believed the house could still see.”</p>

<p>Lily laughed at every warning and called it townie superstition. She liked horror films, the darker the better. The idea of living in a house with creepy rumors amused her more than anything.</p>

<p>She spent her first night taking pictures of the blackout-curtained windows, sending captions to friends:</p>

<var><p>The house that hates the sun.</p></var>

<var><p>Vampire vibes.</p></var>

<p>One window on the second floor did not have curtains, though. It faced the sea. A single lantern sat in that windowsill, flickering faintly yellow behind salt-streaked glass. Whenever Lily looked at it, the flame dipped low, as if noticing her stare.</p>

<hr>

<p>The first sign came when they unpacked the lamps.</p>
<p>Henry screwed in bulbs, but none of them lit.</p>
<p>The outlets hummed softly, like power was there, but every bulb turned black within seconds. As though light dared not exist.</p>
<p>“Wiring must be ancient,” Henry muttered.</p>
<p>Electricians came. They checked breakers, lines, grounds. Everything looked flawless.</p>
<p>Still no light.</p>
<p>Even flashlights weakened here. Batteries drained in minutes. Candles flickered as if suffocating. The lantern upstairs remained the only stable light source, and none of them had placed it there.</p>

<hr>

<p>Nighttime hit different at the Briar House.</p>
<p>Darkness was thicker. Tangible. Lily once waved her hand in front of her face and saw nothing. Not even a blur.</p>
<p>It felt like ink, and she was sinking deeper into it.</p>
<p>The first night she heard breathing.</p>
<p>Slow. Damp. Like something stirring below the floorboards.</p>
<p>She convinced herself it was ocean swell</p>
<p>Then came the tapping.</p>
<p>At 3:07 a.m., sharp knuckles against her wall. Twice.</p>
<p>Tap… tap…</p>
<p>She slid under her blanket, forcing her mind to rationalize it. Old house. Wind. Pipes.</p>
<p>Still, she slept with the blanket over her head until dawn.</p>

<hr>

<p>By October, the family accepted life by candlelight. They joked about it some evenings, but they never joked upstairs.</p>
<p>“Never blow out the lantern,” Sam would insist, clutching his blanket to his chin. “It keeps it asleep.”</p>
<p>Mara would hush him and say it was only a story he invented to feel braver.</p>
<p>Except Sam was not inventing anything.</p>
<p>He had met it.</p>

<hr>

<p>One evening, the parents went to a dinner in town. Lily and Sam stayed home, allowed to watch a movie on Lily’s slowly-dying laptop battery.</p>
<p>Rain hammered the roof. Wind moaned through the stilts. Waves shattered against the cliff.</p>
<p>The lantern upstairs burned bright.</p>
<p>Near midnight, the laptop screen dimmed and died.</p>
<p>Silence returned. Heavy. Hungry.</p>
<p>“Lily,” Sam whispered, “we should go upstairs. The lantern keeps us safe.”</p>
<p>“That’s the dumbest thing I ever heard.” Her voice was harsher than she intended.</p>
<p>Sam’s bottom lip trembled.</p>
<p>“Fine,” she sighed. “Just to prove it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>They climbed the steps. The air grew colder with each stair. The lanternroom door was cracked open, as though waiting.</p>
<p>Inside, the lantern’s flame danced in the center of the room. Everything else drowned in black.</p>
<p>Sam stepped close.</p>
<p>“That’s where it talks to me.”</p>
<p>Lily’s heart thudded.</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>Sam leaned to the lantern and whispered, “The house.”</p>
<p>The flame roared upward, turning blood-red.</p>
<p>The darkness around them breathed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The room stretched.</p>
<p>Not physically. Just the darkness. It expanded like a stomach demanding more.</p>
<p>Lily grabbed Sam’s wrist.</p>
<p>“We’re leaving. Now.”</p>
<p>The door slammed behind them.</p>
<p>The lantern blew out.</p>
<p>Darkness clapped shut.</p>
<p>Something wet slithered across the ceiling.</p>
<p>A low, throaty voice rippled from the walls themselves.</p>
<p><b>Hungry.</b></p>
<p>Lily could not scream. Fear stole her air.</p>
<p>The floor shifted beneath them like a yawning mouth.</p>
<p>Hands. Cold, slick hands rose from the dark, gripping her ankles.</p>
<p>Sam cried out. His voice strangled by terror.</p>
<p>Lily clawed at emptiness, reaching for anything to hold.</p>
<p>Then the lighthouse beam swept across the cliff.</p>
<p>For one single rotation, light cut through the room.</p>
<p>She saw everything:</p>
<p>A face stretched across the entire ceiling</p>
<p>Eyes like extinguished suns.</p>
<p>Teeth made from shattered bulbs.</p>
<p>The house was alive.</p>
<p>And starving.</p>
<p>The light disappeared.</p>
<p>The jaws of the room opened.</p>
<p>Just before she was swallowed whole, the lantern flickered back to life, bursting into violent flame.</p>
<p>A scream that did not belong to any human echoed through the house.</p>
<p>Darkness recoiled. The hands released. The room spat them into the hallway.</p>
<p>Lily shoved Sam down the stairs.</p>
<p>They did not stop running until they reached the street.</p>

<hr>

<p>Neighbors found them drenched in rain, shaking, babbling about a living house that tried to eat them.</p>
<p>Police searched the property. It was empty.</p>
<p>The Briar family never returned for their belongings. They left everything behind except each other.</p>
<p>The house remains.</p>
<p>Electricity never works inside. Flashlights still fail. Curtains still stay shut. The lantern still glows.</p>
<p>And every year on Halloween, the lighthouse flickers for exactly one rotation.</p>
<p>Just enough for anyone standing outside to see the house’s ceiling grin wide, searching, waiting.</p>
<p>Because darkness never forgets what it tastes.</p>
<p>It grows hungrier.</p>
<p>Every night.</p>

<hr>

<p><b><em>Meaning & Reflection</em></b></p>
<p>Light is a fragile comfort. People assume darkness is absence, when in truth darkness can be present. It can want, it can wait, it can feed. The Briar House reminds us that not every hunger is visible and not every home is safe simply because it has walls.</p>
<p>Some shadows do not hide.</p>
<p>They hunt.</p>
