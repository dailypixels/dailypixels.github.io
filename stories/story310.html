      <p>
        At precisely midnight, the 11:59 train vanished. Dozens of witnesses saw it depart the city station, yet when investigators traced the line, it had never arrived anywhere. No wreckage, no signal logs—just silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Detective Eliza Grant was called again, her reputation for solving impossible crimes preceding her. She walked the empty platform, listening to the flicker of the failing overhead lamp. Something felt wrong, as if the station itself was hiding a secret.
      </p>

      <p>
        Studying the tracks, she found grooves that ended abruptly, as if steel rails had been lifted and replaced. The discovery led her to a hidden branch line, buried under false boards. Whoever had designed it had planned for the train to disappear—along with its passengers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deeper investigation revealed a chilling truth: the passengers had not been random. Each was tied to a whistleblower case against a powerful corporation. The train wasn’t stolen—it was silenced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eliza stared at the darkness of the hidden tunnel. The case was no longer about finding a missing train—it was about exposing a force willing to erase lives to bury their crimes. And the clock was ticking before they struck again.
