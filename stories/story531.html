      <p>
        In her grandmother’s attic, Mehwish found a box of yellowed letters tied with a faded ribbon. They weren’t addressed to her grandfather but to someone else—an unknown soldier.
      </p>

      <p>
        The letters spoke of stolen moments, of dreams under wartime skies, of promises to meet again. But the soldier never returned, and the letters were tucked away, never spoken of again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mehwish realized her grandmother had carried two stories all her life: the love she built, and the love she lost. Both were true. Both were hers.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first time, Mehwish understood that hearts can hold more than one kind of truth—and that even forgotten letters still breathe with life.
