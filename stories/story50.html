      <p> The first light hadn’t yet broken when I stepped into the forest. The air was still — so still that even the mist seemed to hold its breath. Each tree stood like a memory carved in bark, ancient and patient. </p> <p> I had come here looking for something I couldn’t name. The city had grown too loud, too quick — every sound fighting to be heard. But here, in the hush between darkness and day, there was no competition. Only the slow rhythm of the earth breathing. </p> <p> The path wound through tall ferns and quiet streams. Every step echoed softly, as though the forest itself were listening. There were no birds yet, no wind — just that suspended moment before everything begins. I felt like an intruder and a pilgrim all at once. </p> <p> At the heart of the forest, I found an ancient tree — wide and hollowed, its roots twisting like the veins of time. Inside, the scent of damp wood carried the weight of centuries. And beneath the bark, I saw faint markings — handprints, layered over each other, hundreds of them. </p> <p> They weren’t carvings. They were traces — as if, long ago, people had pressed their palms here to say, *We were here. We belonged.* </p> <p> I placed my hand upon the same spot. The bark was cold at first, then warm — as though something deep within the tree had awakened. The forest stirred. A whisper of wind brushed through the leaves, soft but certain. Then came a distant sound — the first bird, singing into the fading darkness. </p> <p> The light changed — gold spilling like liquid through the canopy. The silence dissolved into music. Every branch shimmered, every drop of dew caught the sunrise as if celebrating the simple act of beginning again. </p> <p> I realized then — the forest hadn’t been silent. It had been waiting. Waiting for dawn. Waiting for someone to listen. Waiting to remind the world that stillness is not absence — it’s preparation. </p> <p> When I finally stepped back into the open, the world felt lighter. The noise of the city still waited beyond the hills, but something inside me had changed — I could hear it differently now. Because once you’ve heard the language of waiting things, you can never forget how to listen. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Forest That Waited for Dawn* teaches that nature’s quiet is never truly silent — it is full of patience and promise. Just as the forest waits for light, we too must sometimes wait — not in despair, but in readiness — for the next sunrise within ourselves. 🌲✨ </p>
