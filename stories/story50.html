        The platform was nearly empty.  
        Just one flickering light overhead,  
        a single ticket booth long closed for the night,  
        and the low hum of something electric  
        in the distance.
      </p>

      <p>
        I glanced at my watch: **11:53 PM.**  
        Seven minutes until the last train north.  
        But I wasn’t the only one waiting.  
        At the far end of the platform,  
        a man in a long coat stood perfectly still,  
        his face hidden by the shadow of his hat.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Every time I looked away,  
        he seemed closer.  
        At first, it was a trick of the fog,  
        but when I blinked and found him  
        standing by the bench just a few feet away,  
        my pulse quickened.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “Late night for travel,” he said softly.  
        His voice was calm. Too calm.  
        I forced a nod, pretending not to notice  
        his gloved hand resting inside his coat pocket.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The train’s whistle echoed in the distance.  
        Relief washed over me—  
        until the sound of footsteps echoed behind me.  
        Another figure stepped onto the platform.  
        Then another.  
        They weren’t passengers.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “Looks like you’re not leaving after all,”  
        the man whispered.  
        And before I could react,  
        the world erupted in motion—  
        the hiss of brakes,  
        the glow of headlights,  
        and shadows closing in  
        from every direction.
