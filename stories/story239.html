    <main class="story-content">
     <p>It was 11:57 PM at WNXT Radio — the quiet hour when the city outside dissolved into static and whispers. Lydia Marlowe leaned into her microphone, voice calm and magnetic. “You’re listening to Midnight Confessions, where secrets find their echo.”</p>

<p>She had hosted the show for nearly seven years, soothing the sleepless and brokenhearted through the darkness. But tonight felt different. The air was heavy, her reflection in the studio glass pale beneath the red glow of the <em>ON AIR</em> sign.</p>

<p>Three minutes before midnight, the call came in. The line crackled. “You should leave,” a man’s distorted voice said. “There’s going to be a death — tonight.”</p>

<p>Lydia frowned. “Sir, this is a call-in program, not—”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” the voice interrupted. “It’ll happen at 12:03. Listen for the music.” Then the line went dead.</p>

<p>She tried to shake it off — prank calls weren’t new. But when the clock hit 12:03, a song began to play on the studio computer — one she hadn’t queued. The title: <em>Goodbye, Lydia</em>.</p>

<p>The studio lights flickered. A chill crept down her spine. “That’s enough,” she muttered, checking the control board. The system was locked. The door behind her clicked shut.</p>

<hr>

<p>She picked up her phone to call security, but the screen displayed a message: <em>You were warned.</em></p>

<p>Heart pounding, Lydia opened the internal radio feed log — every broadcast, every call was archived. But something new appeared: an entry labeled “FINAL EPISODE.” It was scheduled to air that night at 12:30. She hadn’t recorded anything for it.</p>

<p>She accessed the audio. Her own voice echoed through the speakers:</p>

<p><em>“This is Lydia Marlowe, signing off for good.”</em></p>

<p>She froze. The timestamp on the file? Tomorrow’s date — August 13, 2025 — a recording that hadn’t yet happened.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she noticed something else in the corner of the screen — a live feed camera, broadcasting from inside her studio. Someone was streaming her every move on a hidden channel titled: “The Last Broadcast.” Thousands of viewers. Comments scrolling.</p>

<p><em>Is this real?</em><br>
<em>She looks terrified.</em><br>
<em>Who’s behind her?</em></p>

<p>Lydia spun around — nothing but the dark reflection of herself.</p>

<hr>

<p>Outside, thunder cracked. She checked the locked studio door again, and noticed something taped to it: an envelope marked in smudged red ink. She tore it open. Inside — a single photograph of her at the console, taken from behind the glass, timestamped an hour ago.</p>

<p>Then a voice echoed through her headphones — the same distorted tone. “Now you see, Lydia. You’ve been part of the show all along.”</p>

<p>She ripped off the headset. “Who are you?” she shouted.</p>

<p>“Someone who knows the truth you buried,” the voice replied. “Ten years ago. The highway outside Barlow Creek.”</p>

<p>Lydia’s heart dropped. The accident. The one that had killed her fiancé. The one she’d blamed on the rain — though she’d been the one driving.</p>

<p>“You’ve carried that guilt,” the voice continued. “Now it’s time to confess. Live.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t wrong. She’d buried it for years, hidden behind comforting strangers on air, helping them confront their demons while never facing her own.</p>

<p>But something shifted inside her. “If you want the truth,” she said, leaning toward the mic, “then let’s tell it right.”</p>

<hr>

<p>At 12:29 AM, Lydia went back on air. Her voice shook but grew steadier with every word. “For years, I’ve told others that confession brings peace. Tonight, I need to take my own advice. Ten years ago, I took a life — my fiancé’s — because I was too afraid to slow down. I hid behind my guilt, but not anymore.”</p>

<p>Silence filled the airwaves. Then a click. The studio door unlocked itself.</p>

<p>When the police arrived twenty minutes later, the stream had ended. The feed was gone, the server wiped clean. Lydia sat quietly in the control chair, the red light of <em>ON AIR</em> still glowing above her.</p>

<p>“Everything all right, ma’am?” the officer asked.</p>

<p>She nodded slowly. “For the first time… yes.”</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Broadcast</em> explores how guilt traps us in echoes of our own making. True horror doesn’t always come from outside — sometimes, it’s the truth we silence within. Only by facing it can we finally turn the signal off and step into peace. 📻🕯️</p>
