        Amal often struggled with words. Whenever she prayed aloud, her tongue tangled, her thoughts scattered.  
        One evening, exhausted, she simply sat in silence, hands folded, heart open.
      </p>

      <p>
        The quiet grew deep, wrapping around her like a warm blanket. She felt as though someone listened, even without words.  
        For the first time in years, she wept—not in despair, but in release.
      </p>

      <p>
        She realized prayer wasn’t about eloquence, but presence. A silent heart could speak louder than a thousand spoken words.  
        Peace settled in her soul like dawn breaking over a dark night.
