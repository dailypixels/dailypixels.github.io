        The clocktower had watched over the town for two centuries, its chimes marking births, weddings, and funerals. Then one summer morning, it stopped. At first, people dismissed it as a mechanical failure. But the longer it remained silent, the more the town seemed to change.

        Shops opened later, markets grew restless, and conversations fell into uneasy pauses. No one could explain why the absence of sound felt so heavy. Some whispered the tower had kept more than time—it had kept secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
        When workers finally opened its base, they found not gears or weights, but hundreds of folded letters hidden within the walls, each addressed to “The Keeper of Hours.” No one knew who had written them. And no one dared to open them.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that day, the silence of the tower was no longer just mechanical. It was watchful.
