      <p>
        Detective Elena Vasquez had seen her fair share of strange cases,  
        but nothing like the one creeping through the streets of Ashwood that October night.  
        A thick fog rolled in from the river, swallowing streetlights and muffling footsteps.  
        Somewhere in that haze, a predator moved.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first body appeared near the old railway bridge—  
        lifeless, eyes wide, expression frozen in terror.  
        No fingerprints, no witnesses.  
        Just a message scratched into the pavement:  
        <em>"Look closer."</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Days passed. Each new scene was more elaborate, almost like a game.  
        Elena noticed a pattern: the victims were all connected to the same old case  
        from ten years ago, one that had been quietly buried by higher-ups.  
        Someone was reminding the city, and her, of what was never solved.
      </p>

      <p>
        One rainy evening, she found herself walking the fog-drenched alleys alone,  
        following a lead that felt more like a trap.  
        The shadows shifted strangely, shapes moving at the edge of her vision.  
        Her phone buzzed—a message from an unknown number:  
        <em>"You’re next."</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Heart pounding, Elena realized the killer was inside the police department.  
        Every colleague she had trusted could be the next in the chain of deception.  
        And as she turned a corner, she saw a figure—familiar, too familiar—standing in the mist.
      </p>

      <p>
        The confrontation was sudden and silent.  
        A mask fell, revealing the face she had known since the academy:  
        her mentor, Detective Harris.  
        He confessed to framing the old case, to hiding his own crimes,  
        and now, he was cleaning the slate, one victim at a time,  
        to cover his tracks for good.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elena knew she had to act quickly.  
        A struggle erupted, echoing through the empty streets.  
        In the chaos, Harris slipped and fell into the river, vanishing beneath the fog.  
        She thought it was over—but as she returned to the precinct,  
        a chilling realization hit her: the case files on her desk were not just old—they were updated,  
        with a new entry:  
        <em>"Detective Vasquez – 24/09/2025"</em>
      </p>

      <p class="end-note">
        Elena understood too late: the game wasn’t over. Harris had disappeared,  
        but his shadow remained.  
        And in Ashwood, the fog had a memory.
