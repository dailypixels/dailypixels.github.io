      <p><strong>Part I: The Bridge at Dusk</strong></p>

<p>The bridge hadn’t changed. The same faded planks, the same soft hum of the river beneath — only the city skyline had grown brighter, fuller. Lena stood at the edge, her scarf tugged by the cool November wind. She used to come here every year, on this date. It wasn’t a ritual of hope anymore, just remembrance. A quiet nod to what once was.</p>

<p>Three years had passed since she last saw Ethan. Three years since the night they’d argued on this very bridge — about timing, ambition, and everything love couldn’t quite fix. They had been young and afraid, both chasing dreams in different directions. She had chosen Paris. He had chosen to stay.</p>

<p>Now, she was back — not for him, but for closure. At least that’s what she told herself.</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The Unexpected Return</strong></p>

<p>“Lena?”</p>

<p>The voice came softly, hesitant, like a forgotten melody. She turned, and there he was — Ethan, older somehow, but the same warmth in his eyes. He looked surprised, though not completely. “Didn’t think I’d find you here again,” he said, walking closer.</p>

<p>“I could say the same,” she managed, smiling faintly. “You still visit?”</p>

<p>He nodded. “Every year. Guess I never learned how to let go properly.”</p>

<p>They stood side by side, the river glimmering below. Silence filled the space where apologies didn’t know how to live. Then Ethan pulled a folded envelope from his coat pocket. “You left this,” he said. “The last night. It was in my jacket all along.”</p>

<p>Lena took it, her hands trembling slightly. The paper had yellowed, edges worn. She didn’t remember writing it — only crying that night, packing, leaving before dawn. She opened it slowly, reading her own words for the first time:</p>

<p><em>“If we ever meet again, I hope it’s because we learned how to stop running from each other.”</em></p>

<p>Her throat tightened. “I don’t even remember writing this.”</p>

<p>“I do,” he said quietly. “I read it a hundred times. Thought maybe someday we would.”</p>

<p><strong>Part III: What Time Couldn’t Erase</strong></p>

<p>They walked across the bridge together, their steps soft against the wood. Ethan told her about the small bookstore he now owned — the same one they’d once dreamed of visiting in Florence. She told him about the gallery job that had taken her around the world, how success felt quieter than she expected. The conversation felt like stepping into sunlight after years underground.</p>

<p>“Do you ever think about us?” she asked finally.</p>

<p>He smiled sadly. “Every time it rains. You hated umbrellas.”</p>

<p>She laughed, a real laugh this time. “I still do.”</p>

<p>Their hands brushed accidentally — once, then again — until neither of them pulled away.</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Bridge Between Then and Now</strong></p>

<p>As the sun sank behind the skyline, the city lights shimmered in gold reflection. Lena turned toward him, eyes soft. “Maybe we met too soon the first time,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Or maybe we needed the time apart to find our way back,” he said.</p>

<p>They stood there until twilight turned the river silver. The air smelled like rain — the kind that came softly, forgivingly. When it finally began to fall, she didn’t move. Ethan opened his coat and wordlessly pulled her close.</p>

<p>For the first time in years, the bridge didn’t feel like a memory — it felt like a beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Bridge Between Us</em> is a story about how love doesn’t always vanish when life pulls two people apart — sometimes it waits quietly, across time and silence, for the courage to begin again. It reminds us that second chances aren’t about recreating the past, but about finally being ready for the present. 🌉💫</p>
