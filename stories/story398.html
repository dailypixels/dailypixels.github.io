  <hr>

<p>The first snowfall began as Elion Crest made his way into the forgotten village known as Winter Hollow. Every map he had studied claimed the settlement no longer existed. Yet its chimneys puffed out slow ribbons of smoke, and orange glows flickered through frosted windows as though the past refused to fade.</p>
<p>The cold held a strange quietness, almost expectant.</p>  
<p>When Elion stepped across the weathered sign that marked the village gate, a lantern floated down from the darkening sky. It hovered above his shoulder like an obedient firefly, casting no shadow and no light.</p>
<p>A young girl rushed over from one of the houses. Her hood was rimmed with icy fur, and her eyes reflected the faint shimmer of snowfall.</p>
<p>“You must not touch the lantern,” she warned. “It will show you things you are not prepared to see.”</p>
<p>Elion steadied himself. “I am looking for answers. Seeing is the only way.”</p>
<p>The girl hesitated before nodding. “The lanterns reveal truth. Never light. Never comfort.”</p>
<p>Through the winding paths of Winter Hollow, lanterns drifted freely. Some followed villagers. Others patrolled the empty streets like silent watchers. No matter where Elion went, his lantern stayed close, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat.</p>
<p>He soon learned the village rule:<br>
The lantern chooses what you see, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Elion visited the elder’s lodge, where a circular hearth glowed in blue fire. Elder Morrin, a stooped man wrapped in layers of wool and runes, observed him carefully.</p>  
<p>“Travelers rarely enter Winter Hollow willingly,” the elder said. “What is it you seek?”</p>
<p>“A truth that died with my father,” Elion answered. “I heard rumors he came from this village. I want to know why he left.”</p>
<p>The elder gestured toward the lantern over Elion’s shoulder. “Then let it show you.”</p>
<p>The lantern brightened, swirling into a shape that resembled a glass sphere. Snow drifted within it, revealing fragments of memory not his own.</p>
<p>A younger version of Elion’s father walked through the village, holding a lantern identical to his. His expression was troubled. The vision shifted. Elion saw conflict, arguments with the council, and finally an image that shook him: his father standing over an unlit lantern, refusing to accept what it revealed.</p>
<p>The sphere cracked with a sound like breaking frost.</p>
<p>Elder Morrin spoke quietly. “Your father saw a truth he could not live with. He believed leaving was the only way to escape it.”</p>
<p>Elion’s chest tightened. “What truth?”</p>  
<p>“That he would pass his burden to a child.”<br>
The elder’s gaze softened. “To you.”</p>
<p>The lantern pulsed again. Images flooded Elion’s mind. A lineage connected to the village. A gift, or a curse, bound through blood. His father had fled to protect him from becoming a Keeper of Truth, a role that required sacrificing personal peace for the sake of others.</p>
<p>Elion staggered back.</p>
<p>The young girl from earlier approached with trembling hands. “You do not have to accept it. You can walk away like he did.”</p>
<p>Snow whispered against the window as more lanterns gathered, drawn to the decision he had yet to make.</p>
<p>Elion looked around.<br>
People hid from truths.<br>
People suffered because of truths.<br>
People needed someone brave enough to face them.</p>
<p>He placed his hand beneath the lantern. It drifted lower, circling his palm like a solemn vow.</p>
<p>“I will not run,” he said. “If truth must be kept, then I will keep it.”</p>  
<p>The lantern settled softly onto his shoulder, glowing with a calm steadiness he had not seen before.</p>
<p>Outside, the other lanterns scattered, carrying whispers of both relief and warning across the snowy rooftops.</p>
<p>Winter Hollow had a new Keeper, and the village exhaled as if freed from years of holding its breath.</p>

<h3>✨ Meaning / Reflection</h3>
<p>This story examines the moral weight of truth and the courage required to face revelations that can alter one’s identity. It explores the idea that truth is not inherently comforting yet remains essential for healing, growth, and responsibility. By choosing to carry what his father could not, Elion embodies a generational shift from fear to acceptance.</p>
