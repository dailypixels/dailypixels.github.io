      <p>The studio smelled of turpentine, dust, and quiet regret.</p>

<p>Amira stepped carefully between easels, each holding a half-finished painting — seas of gray and white, stormy and endless. Once, these walls had been alive with color. Now, even the sunlight that crept through the window seemed hesitant, pale.</p>

<p>“Mr. Haleem,” she began softly, setting her recorder on the table, “thank you for agreeing to speak with me.”</p>

<p>The old painter smiled faintly. His hands trembled around a cup of black tea. “It’s been a while since anyone’s asked about my work,” he said. “Or maybe about the man I used to be.”</p>

<p>Amira adjusted the microphone. “You were called ‘the man who painted dreams.’ Your early works were… luminous. What changed?”</p>

<p>He looked out the window, eyes searching a memory only he could see. “Color,” he said. “It betrayed me.”</p>

<p>She waited.</p>

<p>“I woke up one morning,” he continued, “and it was gone. All of it. The blues, the reds, even the warmth of sunlight. The doctor said my eyes were fine. But I knew—it wasn’t the world that lost color. It was me.”</p>

<p>“So you stopped painting?” Amira asked gently.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “No. I started again. I painted the gray, the silence, the ache of forgetting. And for the first time, people said they understood me.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward. “Do you miss it? The colors?”</p>

<p>He smiled. “Miss? No. I found peace in the shadows. You see, I used to chase beauty. Now, I paint truth. Color was never the art—it was the disguise.”</p>

<p>Amira turned off the recorder. Yet she couldn’t shake the feeling that, somehow, his words were still painting something inside her—a hidden truth in quiet tones.</p>

<p>As she left the studio, she glanced back. In the fading light, his latest painting stood complete: a storm breaking into a sliver of dawn.  
Just one color gleamed faintly through the gray—gold.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
Not all loss is an ending.  
Haleem’s story reminds us that even when color fades, creation endures.  
True art isn’t about what we see—it’s about what remains when sight is gone.</p>
