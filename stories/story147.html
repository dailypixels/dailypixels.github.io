      <p><strong>Part I: The Return Address</strong></p>

<p>Every Friday, Eleanor brought fresh flowers to the old post office, a habit she never explained to anyone. She would place them on counter number three — the one that used to be his. Michael. The boy who had written her a hundred letters and sent none.</p>

<p>It had been twenty years since the summer they promised to write every day. Twenty years since war, oceans, and pride tore them apart. Yet even now, whenever the smell of rain filled the air, she could hear his voice in her memory: “If we can’t be together, then let our words be.”</p>

<p>What neither of them knew was that the postmaster, a kind old man named Rourke, had kept their letters. All of them. Stacks of unsent envelopes — one for every month, every missed apology, every heartbeat they’d tried to forget.</p>

<p><strong>Part II: The Discovery</strong></p>

<p>It was winter when the new owner of the post office — a young woman cataloging old archives — found the box labeled *Undelivered Hearts*. Inside were Eleanor’s letters, and Michael’s. Dozens of them, never opened, addressed to one another across decades and countries.</p>

<p>Moved by their story, she decided to deliver them at last.</p>

<p>When Eleanor received the package, she almost didn’t open it. But curiosity — and a tremor of something older — won. Her breath caught as she saw the first familiar scrawl: *“My dearest El, I still look for you in every sunrise.”*</p>

<p>She read until midnight. Letters of love, regret, and hope written in ink that had faded but never bled. Each page was a mirror of her own words, a conversation across time. She learned that he had tried to return, that he’d searched for her, and that life, cruel and persistent, had always placed one more mile between them.</p>

<p><strong>Part III: The Station</strong></p>

<p>Three days later, she went to the train station — the one where they had last said goodbye. The benches were new, the signs brighter, but the air still carried the same scent of steam and rain. She waited, not for anyone in particular, but for something she couldn’t name.</p>

<p>When the 9:45 from Brighton arrived, she turned — and froze. There he was, older, thinner, with silver in his hair and the same crooked smile. Michael. In his hand was an envelope — the last letter he ever wrote but never sent.</p>

<p>They stood in silence as people rushed past. Then, softly, he said, “They found our words.”</p>

<p>Her voice broke. “I thought I’d lost you.”</p>

<p>“You did,” he said gently. “And then you found me again.”</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Letters We Never Sent</strong></p>

<p>They sat together at the café across the street, reading their old letters aloud. There was laughter, and tears, and the strange ache of realizing that love doesn’t vanish — it waits in quiet corners, folded neatly between the lines of what might have been.</p>

<p>When they finished, Michael reached for her hand. “Do you ever wonder,” he asked, “if maybe all the letters we never sent were just waiting for us to be ready?”</p>

<p>She smiled through her tears. “No,” she whispered. “I think they were waiting for us to believe we still could.”</p>

<p>Outside, the rain began to fall again — soft and steady, like a promise rewritten.</p>

<p><strong>Part V: The New Address</strong></p>

<p>Weeks later, Eleanor moved to a small cottage near the sea. Every morning, she and Michael would sit on the porch, writing new letters — not because they needed to, but because they finally could. Their words no longer traveled through time or distance; they stayed close, carried by hands that had learned how to hold, not let go.</p>

<p>And sometimes, when the postman came by, he’d smile at the sight of two envelopes on the table — both addressed simply: <em>To Us.</em></p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Letters We Never Sent</em> reminds us that love doesn’t always fade with time — sometimes it waits patiently to be rediscovered. We spend our lives searching for closure, but the heart doesn’t need an ending; it only needs a chance to begin again. 💌</p>
