        The Marquette Hotel had not seen guests in years.
Its marble floors were cracked, its chandeliers dimmed by time.
But when Elias Noor, a painter haunted by guilt, arrived one rainy night, the caretaker gave him Room 213 — “the quiet one,” she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, everything smelled faintly of turpentine and dust.
And above the bed hung a portrait — a woman with green eyes and a faint, knowing smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t recognize her… until the second night.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s when her eyes moved.
Not wildly — just a subtle glance, following him as he worked at his canvas.
He laughed nervously, called it exhaustion.
But when he slept, he dreamt of her — standing by the window, whispering, “You promised me forever, Elias.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning, he examined the painting closely.
Under layers of varnish and grime, he saw faint brushstrokes he knew by heart — his own signature, hidden beneath another artist’s initials.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had painted her.
He had painted Liora, his lost muse, years ago — before the fire that took her and his memory both.
      </p>

      <p>
        He tore the portrait from the wall, desperate, trembling.
On the back, he found a small envelope sealed with wax. Inside was a lock of hair, and a note written in her delicate hand:
      </p>

      <p>
        “I forgave you long ago. Come find me where we began — before your art forgot my name.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He left the hotel before dawn, the portrait in his arms.
No one saw him again, but the caretaker swore that since that night, Room 213 smelled faintly of roses — and the woman in the painting was smiling brighter than before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meaning / Reflection:
      </p>

      <p>
        Some loves never die — they wait in forgotten places, between brushstrokes and dreams, until memory is brave enough to return.
