        The signal was faint, a whisper buried in static, but it was enough to stop the <em>Odyssey</em> mid-journey. 
        For decades, astronomers had labeled Kepler-1071c as “The Silent Star,” a system where no radio waves or 
        signs of civilization had ever been detected. That night, the silence broke.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Play it again,” Captain Lira said, leaning over the console.  
        The sound filled the command deck: a rhythmic pulse, like a heartbeat, followed by a tone too precise to be natural.  
        Dr. Imani, the ship’s xenolinguist, turned pale. “That’s a pattern. Someone—or something—is calling us.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The crew was divided. Half wanted to chart a new course and report back to Earth. The other half—Lira included—wanted 
        to investigate. They were explorers, after all. And explorers answered calls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours later, the <em>Odyssey</em> descended through a haze of violet clouds. The planet’s surface glimmered like liquid 
        glass, reflecting stars that seemed impossibly close. As they neared a mountain range, a structure emerged:  
        a spire of black stone, taller than any skyscraper, humming faintly in harmony with the signal.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No signs of life,” said Lieutenant Reyes, scanning the surface.  
        But Imani shook her head. “No. It’s alive.” She pointed at the spire. “The signal isn’t coming <em>from</em> the tower.  
        The tower <em>is</em> the signal.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Lira stepped onto the planet’s surface, her boots sank into a ground that rippled like water but held her weight.  
        The air was breathable but charged, every breath tingling like static. She approached the tower, reaching out a hand.  
        The hum grew louder until it wasn’t sound anymore—it was thought.  
        *You came back.*  
      </p>

      <p>
        Memories not her own flooded her mind: a civilization that had burned too bright, too fast, leaving only echoes behind.  
        The tower was their last creation, a message in a bottle cast into the void, waiting millennia for an answer.  
        And now, Lira realized, the answer was her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back aboard the <em>Odyssey</em>, the crew debated what to do. Destroy it? Study it? Leave it alone?  
        But Lira only stared out the viewport at the glowing planet below. The universe had just spoken,  
        and humanity had whispered back. There would be no going home the same.
