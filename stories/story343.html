      <p>
        Every morning, Mia sat by the same coffee shop window, sipping her cappuccino while the city moved outside like a film reel.  
        She never spoke to anyone, but she came alive in watching life pass by—couples holding hands, children skipping puddles, strangers rushing with purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, an elderly woman entered, ordered tea, and sat across from Mia.  
        They exchanged a smile, then a nod, and soon words.  
        Their daily chats grew into a gentle friendship—two souls finding comfort in simple conversations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Months later, the woman stopped coming.  
        Mia worried until one rainy morning she received a letter: “Thank you for making my last winter warm.  
        You reminded me life is still beautiful, even in small moments.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Mia looked out the window again, this time not as a silent observer, but as someone ready to live her own story.  
        The city outside was no longer just passing by—it was inviting her to join.
