        When Daniel lost his job, his sense of worth crumbled. Every day, he walked past a half-collapsed wooden bridge on the edge of town. Its broken planks seemed to mirror his own life—damaged, forgotten, useless.
      </p>

      <p>
        One morning, he noticed a group of volunteers determined to repair it. He hesitated, but something inside him stirred, and he picked up a hammer. At first, his hands trembled. But as the days turned into weeks, the rhythm of nails driving into wood became the rhythm of his healing heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the bridge was finished, Daniel stood at its center. For the first time in months, he felt steady. He realized the bridge wasn’t just rebuilt for the town—it was rebuilt for him, too.
      </p>

        “Sometimes,” he whispered, “you don’t fix things for others. You fix them to find yourself again.”
