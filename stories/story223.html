    <main class="story-content">
      <p>At precisely 02:17 a.m., the first signal appeared — a single repeating pulse on an unused frequency, faint but deliberate. Nathan Cole leaned closer to the console, frowning. He’d worked night shifts at the Coldridge Satellite Relay for eight years and had never seen anything like it.</p>

<p>“Probably interference,” his supervisor mumbled, half-asleep in his chair.</p>

<p>But Nathan wasn’t so sure. The signal wasn’t random. It repeated every seven seconds, with a short pause between clusters — like code. He recorded it, adjusted the filters, and listened again.</p>

<p>Between the static came a voice, barely audible. “...help us… coordinates… 47.19 N… 16.88 E…”</p>

<p>Nathan’s stomach dropped. Those coordinates pointed to somewhere in the Vesterfeld Exclusion Zone — an abandoned region sealed off after the 2013 chemical fires. Officially, it was “uninhabitable.” Unofficially, no one talked about it anymore.</p>

<p>He double-checked the signal. The voice repeated, clearer this time: “Please… they’re still here.”</p>

<p>He turned to his supervisor. “We’re getting a distress call from Vesterfeld.”</p>

<p>The older man blinked, suddenly alert. “That’s impossible. There’s no one left there.”</p>

<p>“Then who sent it?” Nathan whispered.</p>

<p>The supervisor stared at the monitors for a long moment, then quietly stood. “Forget you heard that. Delete the recording.”</p>

<p>“What? Why?”</p>

<p>“Orders from upstairs.”</p>

<p>But Nathan didn’t delete it. He copied the file onto his drive before the system wiped the logs at dawn. All day, the signal echoed in his mind. Who was asking for help in a place that didn’t exist?</p>

<hr>

<p>That night, he drove north — past the warning signs and rusted fences, into the fog-heavy woods that bordered the Exclusion Zone. The GPS flickered, and his phone lost service miles before the border. When he reached the coordinates, his headlights fell on the remains of a research station, half-collapsed and covered in vines.</p>

<p>The air smelled of iron and rain. He stepped inside, flashlight trembling in his hand. The control panels were dead, but the radio tower out back still blinked — faintly, like a heartbeat refusing to stop.</p>

<p>He climbed to the transmitter room. The source of the signal wasn’t automated. It was looping from a small, battery-powered console — still active. Someone had programmed it to repeat endlessly.</p>

<p>Then he saw the note, taped beside it:  
<em>“If you hear this, they found us. Don’t let them erase the truth.”</em></p>

<p>The door slammed below. Footsteps — heavy, deliberate — echoed up the stairs. Nathan froze, heart pounding. A voice called out from the dark hallway.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cole. Step away from the console.”</p>

<p>He turned. Two men in black tactical uniforms emerged from the shadows, no insignias, no names. One of them raised a small device — a signal jammer. The lights on the console died instantly.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” Nathan demanded.</p>

<p>“We clean up mistakes,” the man said. “And you, Mr. Cole, are about to become one.”</p>

<p>Nathan bolted. He ran down the corridor, through shattered doors and hanging wires. A shot rang out, hitting metal inches from his arm. He dove through a side exit, crashing into the underbrush outside.</p>

<p>He didn’t stop until he reached his car, gasping. He shoved the drive into his pocket — the only copy of the signal — and peeled out into the night.</p>

<p>By morning, he reached the city. The signal file was encrypted, but the voice still played clear through his laptop speakers. He uploaded it anonymously to multiple data sites, attaching the coordinates and the recording.</p>

<p>Within 24 hours, the story broke. “Unknown Signal from Restricted Zone — Government Denies Involvement.”  
The relay center was shut down. Nathan vanished a week later.</p>

<p>But sometimes, late at night, radio hobbyists still catch faint echoes of that same signal — still looping after all these years:  
<em>“Please… they’re still here.”</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Signal Room</em> explores the cost of truth in a world built on silence. It reminds us that curiosity, while dangerous, is often the last defense against disappearance — that some signals, no matter how faint, deserve to be heard. 📡🩸</p>
