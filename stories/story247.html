      <p>It was 11:57 p.m. when the phone line blinked red.</p>

<p>Maya Lang leaned closer to the console, her voice smooth through the microphone. “You’re live on Midnight Frequency. Who am I speaking to?”</p>

<p>A long pause. Static filled the silence. Then, a voice — low, calm, trembling slightly. “You don’t know me, but you will. Something terrible is going to happen at 12:17.”</p>

<p>Maya frowned, signaling to her producer behind the glass. “Okay… what’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t matter. Just listen. You’ll hear the sirens soon.”</p>

<p>Click.</p>

<p>The line went dead.</p>

<p>Her producer shrugged. Probably another prank. The city was full of them — lonely insomniacs calling into her late-night show with ghost stories, confessions, and nonsense. Maya brushed it off, forcing a laugh on air. “Looks like we’ve got another time traveler tonight, folks. Remember—keep your clocks running, and your lights on.”</p>

<hr>

<p>At 12:17, the police scanner in the corner crackled to life.</p>

<p>“—Units respond to a 10-54. Possible homicide. Corner of Bay and 9th.”</p>

<p>Maya froze. Bay and 9th. That was two blocks from the studio.</p>

<p>Her producer stared at her, pale. “Coincidence,” he muttered. “Has to be.”</p>

<p>But something in her gut whispered otherwise.</p>

<hr>

<p>Over the next week, the calls continued. Same voice. Same calm tone.</p>

<p>“You’ll see the red car tonight. Don’t let him in.”<br>
“Someone’s following you after the show. Stay on the main road.”<br>
“Don’t trust the man who says he’s here to fix the lights.”</p>

<p>Every time she tried to trace the call, the number vanished — unlisted, untraceable, like it never existed. And every time, the warning came true.</p>

<p>One night, she came home to find her front door ajar. On the table lay a cassette tape. Written on the label: <em>PLAY ME.</em></p>

<p>Her hands shook as she pressed play. Static filled the room, followed by her own voice — from earlier broadcasts — stitched together, edited. Then, the caller’s voice cut in: “You’re not safe anymore, Maya. He’s closer than you think.”</p>

<p>That’s when the lights went out.</p>

<hr>

<p>Maya grabbed her phone, fumbling for the flashlight. The glow revealed muddy footprints leading from the back door to the stairs.</p>

<p>She moved silently, heart pounding. At the top of the stairs — another sound. Breathing.</p>

<p>Her phone vibrated. A new message from an unknown number: <em>He’s behind you.</em></p>

<p>She spun around — nothing. Only shadows and the hum of the city beyond the glass.</p>

<p>Then she heard it again. A voice, low and familiar, coming from the dark.</p>

<p>“You should have listened sooner.”</p>

<p>A figure stepped into the light — her producer.</p>

<p>He smiled faintly. “You made it easy, Maya. Every night, telling me where you’d be, when you’d be alone…”</p>

<p>She stumbled back. “It was you?”</p>

<p>“The caller warned you,” he said, pulling something from his coat pocket — a small tape recorder. “But you didn’t listen.”</p>

<p>Before she could scream, another voice echoed through the room — the same calm tone from the phone calls. “Drop it, Eric.”</p>

<p>Her producer froze. Maya’s eyes widened — the voice came from her speaker system, broadcasting live on air.</p>

<p>“Drop it,” the voice repeated. “We’ve been listening the whole time.”</p>

<p>Moments later, red and blue lights flashed outside her window. The real caller — whoever he was — had saved her life.</p>

<p>When the police took Eric away, Maya stared at the console, the phone still blinking red.</p>

<p>One final message appeared on the screen: <em>You’re safe now. Thank you for listening.</em></p>

<p>The line went dead for good.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Broadcast</em> explores the thin line between paranoia and truth, between fear and instinct. It reminds us that sometimes the voice we doubt the most is the one trying to save us — and silence can be far more dangerous than sound. 📻🕯️</p>
