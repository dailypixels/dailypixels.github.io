        Every morning, Zara took the 7:10 train into the city. She always chose the same seat by the window, her coffee in one hand and her notebook in the other. One day, she found an envelope wedged under the seat—no name, just the words *For the one who waits*.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside was a handwritten letter, a story of longing, describing someone who watched the world through passing train windows. It wasn’t addressed, yet it felt strangely personal. The next day, another letter appeared, this one thanking her “for finding the words I couldn’t speak aloud.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Over weeks, the letters became a dialogue. Zara began leaving her own notes in return. She never saw the writer but began to sense their presence, perhaps just a row away. The letters carried dreams, regrets, small joys—each folded page felt like a heartbeat.
      </p>

      <p>
        One morning, as autumn painted the tracks gold, Zara boarded the train and found no letter. Instead, a book rested on her seat with a final note inside: *I’m sitting two rows behind. Will you turn around?* 
      </p>

      <p>
        She hesitated, then slowly turned. And there, two rows back, someone smiled nervously, holding the same coffee cup she always carried. A stranger, yet not a stranger anymore.
