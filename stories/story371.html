        Farah sat in the corner of her room, the flickering candle casting shadows on the walls. The world outside was chaotic, but here, in the silence, she felt a presence. Not loud, not demanding, just quiet and steady.
      </p>

      <p>
        For months, she had searched for clarity in books, talks, and travels, but peace had always eluded her. That evening, she realized it was not in seeking, but in allowing herself to simply be. The quiet light illuminated not only the room, but her heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        She closed her eyes and breathed deeply. In that stillness, she understood that faith was not about certainty, but presence. The quiet light within her was enough.
