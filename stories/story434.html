        Every year, the town gathered by the river to release paper lanterns into the night. Children giggled as flames flickered to life, while elders whispered names of loved ones who had passed. For one evening, the river became a constellation of memory.

        Leila returned after many years abroad, carrying a lantern of her own. She had written nothing on its surface, unsure what prayer or wish could contain the ache of time lost with her father. As she set it afloat, the lantern wavered, then drifted toward another—her childhood friend’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two lanterns bobbed together as though greeting one another. Leila smiled through her tears. Perhaps the festival wasn’t about what was written, but about what could never be written, carried instead by light and river.
