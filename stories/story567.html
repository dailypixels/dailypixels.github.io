        Nadia liked the corner table by the café window. On rainy days, the glass fogged just enough to make the world outside blur, leaving only the sound of drops and the comfort of her coffee.
      </p>

      <p>
        One morning, she noticed something odd: the man at the next table always came too. Same seat. Same rain. Sometimes reading, sometimes sketching in a notebook. They never spoke, but the rhythm of his presence settled into her routine like a silent companion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks turned to months. The café staff teased her. “Your rainy-day friend is here again.” She laughed it off, but inside, it warmed her.
      </p>

      <p>
        One stormy afternoon, the café was unusually crowded. The only empty seat was across from him. She hesitated, then sat.
      </p>

      <p>
        He smiled. “I was wondering when we’d finally share a table.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Conversation came easily. They talked of books, of art, of why rain made them both feel alive. Hours passed unnoticed.
      </p>

      <p>
        From then on, they didn’t wait for the rain to meet. But still, on stormy days, they returned to the window table, as if honoring the place where silence had become something more.
      </p>

        Meaning / Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        Love doesn’t always announce itself with fireworks. Sometimes it begins in quiet patterns—in shared spaces, small routines, and the courage to finally sit across the table. <b>The most ordinary moments can become extraordinary beginnings</b>.
