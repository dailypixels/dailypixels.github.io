        Sameer Khan interviewed Amal Farid, a community organizer renowned for connecting divided neighborhoods through education, arts, and local projects. Amal emphasized the importance of listening, understanding, and involving everyone in problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can’t lead if you don’t first walk beside people,” she explained. Amal shared stories of initial resistance, failed projects, and breakthroughs that came only through patience and genuine engagement. She highlighted the importance of empowering local leaders and building trust over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the interview, Amal illustrated how communities flourish when people feel included, and how small initiatives — a mural, a workshop, or a clean-up drive — can spark large-scale change. Her approach demonstrated that leadership is less about authority, more about fostering connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end, readers were left inspired to consider their own role in community building, realizing that bridges are not built overnight, but with consistent effort, empathy, and shared vision.
