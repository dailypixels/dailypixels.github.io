        Sami was a quiet boy who loved folding paper. Each boat he made carried a secret wish, a dream he feared saying aloud.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One rainy afternoon, he placed a paper boat on the river, imagining it sailing to a place where his fears could not reach. The current tugged it gently, carrying it beyond the bend.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Weeks passed. Sami felt no different until one morning a stranger knocked on his door with a small gift: a paper crane with his own handwriting inside, thanking him for sharing hope with the world.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Sami understood: even the smallest acts—like a paper boat on a river—could ripple far beyond his imagination. Courage, hope, and dreams traveled quietly, unnoticed but powerful.
