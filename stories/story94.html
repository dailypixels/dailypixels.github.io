      <p>
        Jenna had always felt uneasy walking home from the late shift at the library.  
        But lately, that unease had grown into an unshakable dread.  
        Shadows seemed to move when she wasn’t looking, and the feeling of being watched  
        clung to her like a second skin.
      </p>

      <p>
        One rainy night, she noticed someone following her from a distance.  
        Heart pounding, she quickened her pace, turning corners and scanning empty streets.  
        The figure matched her every move, never making a sound, never showing their face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Determined to confront the stalker, Jenna led them to an abandoned building near the docks.  
        Inside, she found surveillance monitors—screens showing her every step for weeks.  
        The stalker emerged from the shadows, revealing themselves as Detective Harlan,  
        someone she had trusted to protect the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        Harlan confessed he was investigating a series of unsolved disappearances,  
        but his methods had grown obsessive and morally ambiguous.  
        He believed Jenna might hold the key to the final piece of the puzzle,  
        even if it meant terrifying her to uncover it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as tension peaked, a sudden blackout plunged the room into darkness.  
        When the lights returned, Harlan was gone.  
        On the floor was a note: <em>"Trust no one, not even those who watch over you."</em>  
        Jenna realized that the real danger was not the shadows outside,  
        but the secrets hidden behind the faces she thought she knew.
      </p>

      <p class="end-note">
        The city felt different after that night—every familiar corner became a question,  
        every passerby a potential threat.  
        Jenna understood that vigilance is survival,  
        and that even the most trusted guardians can harbor dangerous intentions.
