<p>Ethan Mills spent most of his life in airports and rented rooms. Sales targets ruled his calendar more than birthdays or holidays did. Hotel rooms were just beds to collapse in and alarms to wake to.</p>
<p>The Oakridge Hotel appeared ordinary enough: seventies carpet, fake gold trim, and a tired receptionist chewing gum slowly like she was punishing it. Ethan requested the cheapest room available.</p>
<p>Her gum paused.</p>
<p>“We have one.” She hesitated. “Room 313.”</p>
<p>Her voice carried discomfort, but Ethan only cared about cost.</p>
<p>He signed the form. She slid one key across the counter.</p>
<p>“You can still request another room if you… feel uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>He laughed. “It’s just a room.”</p>
<p>He regretted those words before sunrise.</p>
<p>The hallway to 313 felt too long. The carpet pattern, once floral, twisted into shapes like hands reaching upward. The door to his room stood slightly open, as though waiting for him.</p>
<p>A cold breath of air brushed past him as he entered.</p>
<p>Inside looked normal. Too normal. As if it copied the idea of a room without living up to it. The lamps flickered. The mirror above the desk reflected him a second too late, like it needed to remember how to mimic.</p>
<p>He slept uneasily.</p>
<p>At 2:57 a.m., Ethan woke to knocking.</p>
<p>Not on the door.</p>
<p>Inside the room.</p>
<p>From the wardrobe.</p>
<p>He blamed the pipes. Hotels always had strange noises. He turned over.</p>
<p>The knocking grew louder. Faster.</p>
<p>Then it stopped.</p>
<p>A whisper replaced it.</p>
<p>“Help me…”</p>
<p>Ethan shot up, heart pounding. The wardrobe door rattled violently, as if someone trapped inside fought to escape.</p>
<p>He reached for the doorknob, then froze. A paper note slid out from underneath the door.</p>
<p><em>In messy handwriting:</em><br>
<strong><em>“Do not let it out.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Ethan backed away. The wardrobe fell silent.</p>
<p>He forced himself to stay awake until dawn.</p>
<p>At breakfast, he confronted the receptionist.</p>
<p>She looked terrified when he mentioned the knocking.</p>
<p>“We warn guests. Room 313 was sealed once. A missing person case. A young man stayed there years ago… The staff heard screaming from the wardrobe. When police opened it, he was gone. Only his nails remained… embedded in the wood.”</p>
<p>Ethan demanded a room change. She agreed immediately.</p>
<p>A bellboy accompanied him to pack his things.</p>
<p>When they entered 313, the wardrobe stood open.</p>
<p>Deep claw marks cut through the wooden interior. Dark stains filled the grooves.</p>
<p>The mirror was different too.</p>
<p>Words appeared across its surface as if traced by a wet finger:</p>
<p><strong>“LET ME FINISH WHAT HE STARTED.”</strong></p>
<p>Ethan grabbed his bag and ran. The bellboy followed closely, refusing to look back.</p>
<p>Relocated to Room 108, Ethan breathed easier. New walls. New bed. A door he could trust.</p>
<p>Until 2:57 a.m.</p>
<p>Knock. Knock.</p>
<p>From the wardrobe.</p>
<p>Ethan stood paralyzed. His phone flashed on the nightstand.</p>
<p>A notification he did not want to read:</p>
<p><strong>ROOM 313 IS CALLING…</strong></p>
<p>The call ended before he could react.</p>
<p>The wardrobe creaked open behind him.</p>
<p>A hand, pale and stretched too thin over bone, emerged first.</p>
<p>Then the rest of it crawled out… a twisted figure of a man whose face had peeled away, replaced by darkness that moved like a swarm of insects.</p>
<p>It whispered with a voice both male and female layered together:</p>
<p>“You should have stayed.”</p>
<p>The door to Room 108 slammed shut. Locks turned. Lights died.</p>
<p>Ethan screamed.</p>
<p>Hotel staff never heard it.</p>
<p>In the morning, the receptionist noticed his check-out time had passed. Room 108 was empty. His belongings were gone except for one key.</p>
<p>Room 313.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>The hotel keeps renting it.</p>
<p>Someone always thinks warnings are superstition.</p>
<p>Something inside needs them to believe that.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning & Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Ignoring signs of danger does not remove the danger itself. Some histories cling to places like wounds that refuse healing. Curiosity, arrogance, and disbelief often lead people directly into the jaws of the unknown. The past never stays buried when something inside hungers for the next one who refuses to listen.</p>
