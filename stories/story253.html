        Rain tapped gently on the city streets as Nora hurried toward the café where she and Liam had agreed to meet. Memories of their last encounter—filled with unsaid words and lingering glances—flooded her mind. Today was different; today, they would confront feelings they had both buried over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liam waited inside, hands wrapped around a warm cup of coffee. As Nora entered, their eyes met, and for a moment, the world outside faded. “You made it,” he said softly. “I wouldn’t miss this,” she replied. They shared a smile, hesitant yet full of hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sitting together by the window, rain streaking the glass, they spoke of the years apart—the challenges, the regrets, and the love that had never truly faded. Each confession peeled back layers of hesitation and fear. Liam reached for Nora’s hand. “I’ve missed saying what I felt,” he admitted. Nora’s voice trembled, “I’ve missed hearing it.” The simple exchange bridged the gap time had created.
      </p>

        Hours passed unnoticed as laughter mingled with tears. They shared stories of growth and change, realizing that distance had not weakened their bond, but rather prepared them for a more honest connection. The rain outside mirrored the cleansing of past misunderstandings, washing away doubts and fears.
      </p>

        Eventually, the rain slowed to a drizzle, and they stepped outside, sharing a single umbrella. Walking through glistening streets, hand in hand, every puddle and reflection seemed to celebrate their reunion. “I don’t want to waste another day,” Liam whispered. Nora smiled, resting her head on his shoulder. “Neither do I. From now on, we face life together.” The rainy day had become a turning point, a beginning of a love reaffirmed and strengthened by time and truth.
