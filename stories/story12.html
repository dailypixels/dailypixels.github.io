        The road ended hours ago, replaced by a narrow trail carved into the mountainside. My boots crunched over gravel as the wind 
        carried whispers from the valley below. Each step felt like a conversation with the earth—ancient, steady, and unbothered 
        by the heartbeat hammering in my chest.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had dreamed of this place since childhood: a remote range where maps blur into blank space and clouds drift so low they 
        graze the cliffs. The air was thin, sharp with pine and frost. With every turn, the horizon stretched wider, the peaks 
        rising like guardians of a forgotten kingdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        By midday, I reached a ledge overlooking a glacier lake, its surface a mirror of the sky. The silence was profound, broken 
        only by the occasional crack of ice shifting far below. I set down my pack, my fingers numb but my heart warm. I’d come 
        for this—the feeling of standing at the edge of the world, untethered from everything except wonder.
      </p>

      <p>
        A storm rolled in as evening approached, clouds curling like ink across the peaks. Lightning split the sky, and the mountain 
        answered with thunder that rattled through my bones. I huddled beneath a rocky overhang, notebook in hand, scribbling down 
        every detail I could before the rain washed it away.
      </p>

      <p>
        When dawn came, the world was transformed: the storm had passed, leaving a sky painted in gold and lavender. I climbed higher, 
        until I could see the curve of the earth, until I felt like I was walking on the spine of something ancient and alive. 
        Up there, alone with the wind, I understood why some people spend their whole lives chasing mountains. 
        It’s not just about the view—it’s about becoming part of it.
