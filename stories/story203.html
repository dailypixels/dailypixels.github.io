      <p>
        Liam had always believed in destiny, but after years apart, he wondered if he and Eliza had been pulled in different directions for good. Fate, however, had other plans. One chilly evening, he found himself at the old hill where they used to watch meteor showers together.
      </p>

      <p>
        To his astonishment, Eliza was already there, sketching the constellations in her notebook. Their eyes met, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still. The hill, the stars, and the quiet night sky carried memories of laughter, confessions, and dreams shared long ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        They began to talk, hesitantly at first, sharing the stories of their years apart, the successes, the struggles, and the small joys they had discovered. Slowly, the conversation grew warm and familiar, laughter returning effortlessly. It was as though the universe had orchestrated this moment, bringing them back together when they were ready to recognize the depth of their love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liam reached for Eliza’s hand, feeling the comfort and certainty that only comes from a bond that time cannot break. “I never stopped believing in us,” he said softly. Eliza smiled, her eyes shimmering with emotion. “I’ve always known we’d find our way back to each other.” In that shared silence, beneath the vast, twinkling sky, they felt their hearts align once more.
      </p>

      <p>
        As meteors streaked across the night, they made quiet wishes together, realizing that love, when true, endures separation, challenges, and the twists of life. That evening, Liam and Eliza understood that sometimes the stars guide hearts back together, illuminating a path meant to be walked hand in hand.
