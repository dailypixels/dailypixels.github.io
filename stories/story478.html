        When Nina first saw the bridge, it felt impossibly long. Stretching across a wide river, its wooden planks seemed endless, creaking under the footsteps of travelers who crossed before her. She had failed many times before—at school, at jobs, at relationships—and this bridge became her metaphor.  
      </p>
      <p>
        “One plank at a time,” she whispered, placing her foot forward.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The river roared beneath, reminding her of doubts, regrets, and fears that could easily swallow her. But with each step, the far side grew clearer. The sunrise painted the sky, urging her on.  
      </p>
      <p>
        When Nina reached the other side, she turned back. The bridge hadn’t shrunk—the river hadn’t calmed. What had changed was her: she had crossed. Sometimes, life doesn’t demand leaps of greatness, only the courage to take small steps consistently.
