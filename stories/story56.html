        It started with a simple mistake.  
        I left my phone unlocked on the couch.  
        My dog, Max, has a talent for pawing at screens.  
        Usually, he just opens YouTube or takes  
        47 blurry selfies of his nose.  
      </p>

      <p>
        But that night, the universe had other plans.  
        I heard a knock at the door thirty minutes later.  
        There stood a delivery guy holding a large pepperoni pizza.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’ll be $18.75,” he said.  
        I stared at him, then at Max—  
        who was wagging his tail proudly,  
        like he’d just invented fire.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Turns out Max had somehow hit my food app,  
        tapped “reorder last,”  
        and Face ID (with my sleepy face still in view)  
        confirmed the purchase.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The best part?  
        Max hates pepperoni.  
        He just wanted the crust.  
        So yes, I paid $18.75 for a dog to eat two crusts  
        and leave me with an entire pizza.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn’t even complain.  
        Honestly, he deserved it.  
        From that day on, Max has been known  
        in our neighborhood as  
        “The Pizza Dog.”
