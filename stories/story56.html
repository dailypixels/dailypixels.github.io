    <main class="story-content">
      <p> The train had dropped me off in the middle of nowhere. A town called *Ravensbridge* — one main street, one tavern, one hotel leaning against the cliffs like it was tired of standing. I’d come to write a feature on “vanishing towns,” places that had fallen off the map. But I hadn’t expected the town itself to feel… erased. </p> <p> The *Harrow Inn* looked like it had been built for ghosts. The woman at the reception barely looked up from her ledger when I arrived. “Room 312,” she said flatly. “End of the hall.” I nodded, signed the book, and carried my bag upstairs. But when I reached the corridor, I noticed something strange — the numbers jumped from 311 to 313. </p> <p> I laughed it off. Old buildings often skipped unlucky numbers. But as I passed 313, I felt a breeze — cold and sudden, like someone opening a window behind me. I turned. There was a door between 311 and 313. No number. Just a faint outline, almost as if the wall itself had changed its mind. </p> <p> That night, I couldn’t sleep. The floorboards creaked as if someone walked the hall outside. At 2:13 a.m., I heard it — three knocks, steady, deliberate. I opened my door. The hallway was empty. But the hidden door was there again, clearer this time, the brass handle glinting in the moonlight. </p> <p> I should have ignored it. I didn’t. The handle turned easily. The door opened inward, and I stepped inside. The room was identical to mine — same bed, same curtains, same mirror — but colder. Dust lay thick across the floor, and the air smelled faintly of smoke. </p> <p> On the nightstand was a notebook. My notebook. The same leather cover, same initials pressed into the spine — *R.E.* I flipped it open. The handwriting was mine. The first entry read: <br><em>“Day 1 — Checked into Harrow Inn. The town is quiet. The woman downstairs doesn’t remember me, but she will.”</em> </p> <p> I froze. My pulse thundered in my ears. I kept reading. <br><em>“Day 3 — The room keeps moving. They keep telling me there’s no Room 312.”</em> <br><em>“Day 5 — I think I’ve been here before.”</em> </p> <p> My breath caught. A sound behind me — a soft click, like a door closing. I turned, but the hallway was gone. Only the mirror remained. My reflection stood there, but it didn’t move when I did. Instead, it smiled. </p> <p> “You shouldn’t have come back,” it whispered. The glass fogged over with each word. I stumbled back, heart racing, reaching for the knob — but the door wouldn’t budge. The mirror shimmered, and for a moment, I saw something beyond it — the same room, years older, furniture rotted, dust like snow. And in that reflection, I was sitting on the bed, writing. </p> <p> The notebook slipped from my hands. Its last entry was written in shaking ink: <br><em>“If you find this, leave the room before it finds you.”</em> </p> <p> The next thing I remember is waking up in the lobby, dawn filtering through the windows. The receptionist blinked when she saw me. “Checking out already?” she asked. “I—I was in 312,” I said. She frowned. “We don’t have a 312, sir. We haven’t since the fire. Twenty years ago.” </p> <p> My throat went dry. “Who… who was in there before?” She looked at me strangely. “A travel writer. Name was Rayan Elwood, I think. Died in the blaze.” </p> <p> I left Ravensbridge that morning. But sometimes, in dreams, I’m back there — standing at the end of that hallway, watching a door fade in and out of the wall. And every time I try to open it, I find my hand already on the other side. </p>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Room That Wasn’t There* is a reminder that curiosity has two edges — one that opens doors, and one that traps us behind them. Some mysteries aren’t meant to be solved; they’re meant to warn us that not every reflection belongs to the living. 🚪🕯️ </p>
