        They said no one went into the woods after dusk.  
        But Leah never believed in local legends.  
        She carried her lantern and recorder,  
        determined to capture the truth about the voices  
        hikers claimed to hear.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, it was only silence and the crunch of leaves.  
        Then, as the moon broke through the branches,  
        a whisper carried through the trees.  
        <em>“Go back…”</em>  
        It wasn’t wind. It was speech—low, deliberate.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Leah steadied her recorder.  
        “Who’s there?” she called.  
        The whisper returned, this time behind her.  
        <em>“Go back…”</em>  
        She spun around, lantern trembling,  
        but only shadows stretched across the moss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Minutes stretched like hours.  
        Then she noticed it—the echo wasn’t just repeating words.  
        It was answering her thoughts.  
        Every fear she buried, every memory she avoided,  
        the echo spoke them aloud in her own voice.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Panic surged. She ran,  
        branches clawing at her jacket,  
        heart pounding louder than her footsteps.  
        But the forest path never ended.  
        No matter how far she sprinted,  
        the same twisted tree reappeared before her.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lantern sputtered out.  
        Darkness consumed her.  
        In that black silence, the echo spoke one last time—  
        not as her voice, but her mother’s.  
        <em>“Welcome home.”</em>
