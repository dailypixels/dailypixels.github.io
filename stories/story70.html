        It started with spilled coffee.  
        Not the kind of dramatic spill that ruins everything—  
        just a small drop that landed on my book,  
        right in the middle of a love poem.  
        He apologized so quickly,  
        I barely had time to be annoyed.  
      </p>

      <p>
        His name was Daniel,  
        and he’d been coming to the same café for weeks.  
        I had noticed him before—  
        always with a notebook, always scribbling,  
        always looking like the world outside didn’t exist.  
      </p>

      <p>
        That evening, rain tapped against the windows,  
        and for the first time,  
        instead of writing alone,  
        he sat across from me.  
      </p>

      <p>
        We talked until the café closed.  
        About books,  
        about music,  
        about all the things we swore  
        no one else understood.  
        And when the lights dimmed,  
        neither of us wanted to leave.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the weeks, the café became *ours*.  
        A quiet little corner table by the window,  
        where life slowed down just enough  
        to let us imagine a future.  
      </p>

      <p>
        But Daniel had dreams bigger than the city—  
        he’d been accepted to a fellowship abroad.  
        The night he told me,  
        I smiled through the ache in my chest.  
        Because love isn’t about keeping someone still;  
        it’s about letting them fly.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Our last night together,  
        we didn’t make promises we couldn’t keep.  
        We just held hands,  
        listened to the rain outside,  
        and let the silence say everything.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Months later, I still sit at that café sometimes.  
        The chair across from me is empty,  
        but the memory isn’t lonely.  
        Because some loves don’t vanish—  
        they linger, like the smell of coffee,  
        reminding you that once,  
        someone made the world feel brighter.
