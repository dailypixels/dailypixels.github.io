     <p> When they were twelve, Ethan and Mira carved their initials into the bench — the one under the big maple tree that always dropped its leaves too early. <br><br> They used a pocketknife Ethan had stolen from his father’s toolbox. It wasn’t rebellion; it was proof of forever. “If we ever lose touch,” Mira said, “let’s meet here. Same day. Same time. Twenty years from now.” <br> He laughed. “You think we’ll still remember?” <br> “I will,” she said, grinning. “You’re the forgetful one.” </p> <p> Time did what it always does — folded them into separate pages. <br> Ethan’s family moved to another city. Mira’s father passed away. Letters became emails, then messages, then silence. <br> They grew up — or tried to — carrying pieces of that park inside them without realizing it. </p> <p> Twenty years later, Ethan stood by the same gate — older, cautious, and unsure why his heart was racing like a teenager’s again. <br> The park looked smaller. The swings were gone. The maple tree stood taller, but the bench — that same, weathered bench — waited patiently. <br> He sat down, two coffees in hand. One black, one sweet — the way she used to drink it. </p> <p> He waited through the afternoon, the evening, and into the faint blue of twilight. Every time footsteps echoed, he looked up, and every time, they weren’t hers. <br> He thought about leaving a note — maybe something poetic, something simple like *“I came.”* <br> But as he reached for his pen, a voice behind him said softly, “You’re late again.” </p> <p> He turned. <br> Mira stood there, wrapped in a scarf that matched the color of autumn leaves. Her hair was streaked with gray, but her eyes — they were exactly the same. <br> “I thought you wouldn’t remember,” he said. <br> “I almost didn’t,” she smiled faintly. “Then I saw a maple leaf fall this morning, and it hit me — it’s today.” </p> <p> They talked for hours — about everything and nothing. <br> About jobs they didn’t love, people they almost married, cities they left, books they never finished. <br> When the streetlights came on, Mira said quietly, “You know what I missed most?” <br> “What?” <br> “The way silence never felt heavy with you.” </p> <p> Ethan nodded. “Some people make even silence sound like music.” <br><br> The wind rustled. The bench creaked. The maple tree shed another leaf, which landed between them — a golden bookmark in their shared story. </p> <p> When it got late, Mira stood. “We’ll meet again?” <br> “Same bench,” he said. “But maybe sooner this time.” <br> She smiled, touching the old initials carved into the wood. “Let’s not wait for twenty years to remember we care.” </p> <p> The next morning, a park cleaner found two empty cups on the bench — one black, one sweet — and a small note left under a leaf. <br><br> It read: <br> *“The bench kept our promise when we almost forgot.”* </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Last Bench in the Park* is about the quiet strength of friendship — the kind that doesn’t fade, even when time or distance do their best to erase it. <br> It reminds us that some connections don’t demand constant presence; they simply wait — patiently, like a bench under a maple tree — for the day we finally remember to sit down again. 🍂☕ </p>
