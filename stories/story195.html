      <p>
        Harper had spent months avoiding the little café where she and Owen had shared countless afternoons. Memories of laughter, whispered confessions, and the warmth of his hand lingered in every corner. Today, however, she found herself drawn back, uncertain but hopeful.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bell above the door jingled as she entered, and there he was—Owen, seated by the window, sketching absentmindedly. Their eyes met, and a silence filled with years of unspoken feelings settled between them. Harper’s heart raced, yet a strange sense of peace accompanied the familiar flutter.
      </p>

      <p>
        They spoke cautiously at first, words tentative, trying to bridge the gap of months spent apart. But soon, laughter returned, as effortless and warm as it had been in their shared past. They reminisced about simple joys, the storms they had weathered, and the dreams they once shared. Every glance revealed emotions neither had dared voice before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Owen reached across the table, gently taking her hand. “I never stopped thinking about us,” he said softly. Harper smiled, tears glistening. “Neither did I. I was just scared that time had changed everything.” In that touch, the years melted away, leaving only the truth they had always known—their hearts belonged together.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the afternoon sun cast golden light through the café window, they talked, laughed, and planned anew. Harper realized that love, when genuine, endures distance, fear, and hesitation. The café, once a place of bittersweet memories, had become the setting for their new beginning—proof that hearts separated by circumstance can find their way back.
