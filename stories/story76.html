    <main class="story-content">
     <p> The river *Nirval* was quiet that morning. Mist drifted over its surface like forgotten dreams. <em>Arun Das</em> stood at the edge of the bridge, his breath visible in the cold air. He had been standing there for nearly an hour, watching the water flow beneath, as if waiting for it to tell him what to do next. </p> <p> Just one year ago, Arun had been a teacher, a husband, and a father. Then came the storm ‚Äî the flood that swept through his village, carrying away his home, his school, and the two people he loved most. Since then, he had wandered between towns, fixing small things for food, never speaking much, never staying long. </p> <p> Now, he had returned to the village ‚Äî or what was left of it. He found only the remains of the school walls and a bridge he used to cross with his daughter every morning. The villagers said it was unsafe now, half-rotted and ready to fall. But to Arun, it was the only thing still standing from the life he‚Äôd lost. </p> <p> As he took his first step onto the bridge, the wood groaned beneath his weight. The mist thickened, and the river below whispered softly, like a memory trying to surface. Halfway across, he stopped. The air was heavy, the silence absolute ‚Äî until he heard the faintest laugh. High, bright, familiar. His daughter‚Äôs laugh. </p> <p> He turned sharply, heart pounding. No one was there. Only the wind brushing through the reeds. But the sound came again ‚Äî clearer this time, drifting through the fog. He closed his eyes, tears burning his face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt save you.‚Äù </p> <p> And then, a voice ‚Äî not real, but remembered ‚Äî spoke softly: <em>‚ÄúThen live for us, Baba. Cross the bridge. You still have somewhere to go.‚Äù</em> </p> <p> His knees trembled, but he kept walking. Every step felt like a memory ‚Äî the sound of his wife‚Äôs song, his daughter‚Äôs tiny footsteps, the warmth of sunlight on a chalkboard. When he reached the other side, the fog began to lift. The first light of dawn broke through the clouds, turning the river gold. </p> <p> There, on the far bank, stood a small group of villagers rebuilding their homes. One of them looked up and called, ‚ÄúArun! We could use a teacher again. Will you stay this time?‚Äù </p> <p> He didn‚Äôt answer immediately. He looked back once at the bridge, then at the river, now calm and shining. He smiled faintly and nodded. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to start again.‚Äù </p> <p> That evening, he joined them ‚Äî teaching children under a half-built roof, laughter echoing through the twilight. And though the bridge behind him creaked in the wind, he no longer feared it. It was no longer something to cross. It was something to remember ‚Äî proof that broken things can still lead you forward. </p>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Bridge of Quiet Steps* is a story about loss, renewal, and the quiet courage it takes to begin again. Sometimes healing doesn‚Äôt arrive all at once ‚Äî it comes in steps, in breaths, in the act of choosing to move. It reminds us that no bridge is too broken to cross, and no heart too shattered to rebuild ‚Äî if we have the strength to take one step forward. üåÖ‚ú® </p>
