      <p>
        Before video calls, before instant messaging,  
        there were letters.  
        And for Maya and Ethan,  
        words written on paper carried  
        more weight than spoken promises.
      </p>

      <p>
        They met one summer in Lisbon—  
        two travelers whose paths briefly crossed.  
        One rainy evening, they shared an umbrella,  
        a laugh, and eventually, a kiss  
        on the cobblestone streets.  
        By the time the sun rose,  
        they knew their lives were heading  
        in different directions.  
        She back to Mumbai, he back to Toronto.
      </p>

      <p>
        They could have ended it there.  
        But Ethan sent the first letter.  
        A week later, Maya replied.  
        Slowly, envelopes traveled across oceans,  
        carrying secrets, fears, and growing affection.  
        Her neat handwriting became  
        his favorite sight.  
        His messy sketches made her laugh  
        louder than anything else.
      </p>

      <p>
        Months turned into years.  
        They built their love in ink,  
        through lines that smelled faintly of cologne  
        and paper crinkled by tears.  
        When Maya’s mother fell sick,  
        Ethan’s words carried her.  
        When Ethan lost his job,  
        Maya’s letters reminded him  
        he was more than his failures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, after three long years,  
        they agreed to meet again.  
        The same city where it all began.  
        Lisbon.  
        Maya arrived at the square first,  
        her heart pounding as every passerby  
        made her breath catch.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Then she saw him.  
        Taller than she remembered,  
        older too—yet his smile  
        was exactly the same.  
        He carried no flowers, no gifts,  
        only a stack of worn envelopes  
        tied with a ribbon.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I kept them all,” Ethan whispered,  
        handing the letters back to her.  
        Maya laughed through her tears,  
        dropping the stack as she threw her arms  
        around him.  
        The streets of Lisbon bustled on,  
        but for them, time had stopped—  
        sealed forever between  
        the lines of their letters.
