        In a quiet quarter of Karachi lived an artist known only as Yousuf. He never held exhibitions, never sold his work. Yet his studio walls were lined with hundreds of portraits—faces of men, women, and children that seemed hauntingly familiar, though none could recall meeting them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a journalist finally persuaded Yousuf to speak, he revealed that each face came from memory. He painted strangers glimpsed briefly at bus stops, markets, and train stations—people whose presence would otherwise fade into the anonymity of the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Every face deserves to be remembered,” he said. “Even if no one else knows them.” His brush was not capturing fame, but dignity. He gave permanence to fleeting existence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, one visitor recognized her grandmother among the paintings. Tears welled as she realized Yousuf had unknowingly preserved a moment of her family’s past. It was proof that memory and art could conspire to save even what time tried to erase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yousuf passed away quietly, his portraits left behind. His studio became a gallery where strangers came searching, hoping to find someone they once knew, or perhaps themselves reflected in the forgotten faces.
