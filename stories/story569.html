      <p>
        Every night at exactly midnight, Sameer’s landline rang. No one used landlines anymore, but the phone had come with the apartment, heavy and old-fashioned.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first night, he ignored it.
The second, he answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        A whisper slid through the line: “I’m outside.”
      </p>

      <p>
        His skin prickled. He looked out the window. The street was empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Night after night, the calls returned. Always the same words, sometimes followed by a laugh too faint to be human. He unplugged the phone. At midnight, it rang anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Desperate, Sameer told his friend. The friend laughed, stayed over to prove him wrong. At midnight, the phone rang. Together, they answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two voices whispered this time: “We’re inside.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The lights flickered. When they came back on, the friend was gone. Only Sameer remained, holding the receiver, hearing his own voice whisper back to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        By morning, the phone sat silent. But in the reflection of its polished black surface, Sameer saw movement—a pale hand reaching out.
      </p>

      <p>
        He threw the phone into the street. But every midnight, no matter where he was, a new phone appeared on his table. Waiting.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Meaning / Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        The story reminds us that <b>fear feeds on attention</b>—the more we try to confront or escape it, the deeper it roots itself. Some calls should never be answered.
