      <p>
        Every evening, under the stone arch of Brookfield Bridge, a violinist played. His name was Samuel, and though few knew his story, everyone knew his music. It echoed across the river, blending with the hum of traffic and the footsteps of passersby.  
      </p>

      <p>
        For the homeless man who slept nearby, Samuel’s music was comfort. For children walking home, it was adventure. For tired workers returning late, it was peace. Each person carried away something different, yet all shared the same melody.  
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, a young girl named Mary asked Samuel why he played there, instead of on a grand stage. He smiled and said, “Bridges are meant to connect. Music is my way of building one every day.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks later, Samuel disappeared. The bridge was silent—until one evening, people began to gather with their own instruments: guitars, flutes, even pots and pans. Inspired by him, they carried his tradition forward, turning the underpass into a living symphony of strangers.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Samuel’s music beneath the bridge had not ended—it had multiplied, proving that connection is the truest form of legacy.
