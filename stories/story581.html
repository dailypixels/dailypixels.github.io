    <main class="story-content">
      <p>When Sana entered the old radio station, the air carried a faint scent of dust and forgotten debates. She had interviewed many people in her career, but this one felt different. It wasn’t a headline she was chasing — it was closure.</p>

<p>Across the desk sat Rafiq Malik, once a powerful minister, now a recluse living with ghosts of promises never kept. The “ON AIR” light flickered red, and for a long moment, neither spoke.</p>

<p>“You used to speak for hours,” she finally said, her recorder blinking quietly between them.</p>

<p>He smiled faintly. “And yet I said nothing that mattered.”</p>

<p>Sana leaned forward. “Then why agree to this interview?”</p>

<p>Rafiq’s fingers brushed against the edge of the microphone. “Because I thought it was time someone asked me the right questions.”</p>

<p>Outside, thunder rolled. The conversation meandered — from his fall from grace to the factories he promised but never built. He spoke not to defend himself, but as though each word were a brick removed from a collapsing wall inside him.</p>

<p>“Do you regret it?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>He looked up. “No… I regret that I learned the truth too late — that people don’t need leaders who speak, they need ones who listen.”</p>

<p>Sana turned off the recorder, realizing she already had the story she came for — and it wasn’t about him, but about all who still believed that change began with noise, not silence.</p>

<p>As she left, the storm outside had eased. Through the studio glass, she saw him still sitting there — lips moving, perhaps rehearsing the answers he’d never given when the world was listening.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
Sometimes the most powerful interviews are the ones that end in silence.  
Words can hide, but silence reveals — not just the truth of the speaker, but of ourselves listening.</p>
