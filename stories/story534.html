      <p>
       In the narrowest alley of the old town stood a shop most people overlooked. Its door was crooked, its sign barely legible: “Rowe’s Timepieces.” Inside, clocks of every kind ticked and chimed, weaving a chorus of seconds and minutes that never aligned.
      </p>

      <p>
      Elias Rowe, the clockmaker, had worked there all his life. His hands were steady, his eyes sharp, but there was one watch he could never fix — a small silver pocket watch, its glass cracked, its hands forever frozen at 3:17.
      </p>

      <p>
        No customer knew why it stayed on his workbench. They came for repairs and left with working clocks, unaware that every tick he restored was, in his heart, an attempt to stitch together a single memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        That memory was of Clara. She had given him the watch on the morning she left for the train, promising she would return in spring. The train had arrived safely, but she had not. The town spoke in whispers, but Elias never asked questions. He only listened to the silence of the watch and waited.
      </p>

      <p>
        One stormy evening, a boy came into the shop holding his father’s broken wristwatch. “It stopped,” the boy said. Elias smiled gently and repaired it in silence. When he handed it back, the boy’s eyes lit up — and in that spark, Elias saw Clara’s laughter again.
      </p>

      <p>
       That night, as he wound the frozen pocket watch one last time, the hands twitched, then moved. Slowly, the watch ticked forward, past 3:17.
      </p>

      <p>Elias leaned back in his chair. The clocks around him chimed together for the first time in years. He closed his eyes, not in sadness but in peace, as though time itself had kept its promise.</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>The story reflects how grief freezes us in place, but healing arrives in unexpected ways. By helping others move forward, Elias finally freed himself from the moment he had been trapped in. Time, like love, cannot be repaired — only carried onward.</p>
