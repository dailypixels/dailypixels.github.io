        “When I run, I’m not racing anyone but myself,” said Akbar, a twenty-six-year-old mountain runner from Gilgit-Baltistan. He had just returned from an international ultramarathon where he placed in the top ten despite training without modern facilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our interview, Akbar described waking up before dawn to train along rocky paths, carrying water bottles in a backpack because there were no coaches or support cars. His first pair of running shoes had been stitched together three times before he finally earned enough to buy a new pair.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The mountains are my coach,” he laughed. “They test me, they break me, but they also teach me endurance. Every climb is a lesson in patience.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He admitted there were days he wanted to quit, especially when injuries piled up. But each time, the memory of his village children cheering him on pulled him back to the trails. “I want them to believe that you don’t need privilege to chase a dream. You just need courage that doesn’t give up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As the interview ended, Akbar tied his worn shoes and prepared for another run. His words lingered: “Medals fade. What lasts is proving to yourself that you can go further than you ever thought possible.”
