      <p>
        The mountain air was cold enough to sting my cheeks, but I barely noticed.  
        I had climbed all night, following a narrow path lit only by moonlight,  
        determined to see the sunrise from the top.  
        It was a promise I made to myself months ago, when life felt heavier than I could carry.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the summit, I sank onto a boulder, lungs burning, legs trembling.  
        The horizon was still dark, but a soft glow began to spread,  
        turning the sky a pale lavender. I wrapped myself in my jacket and waited.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Then it happened—golden light spilling over the peaks,  
        touching the world like a gentle hand.  
        The valley below shimmered with morning mist,  
        and for the first time in a long while,  
        I felt something unshakable: hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        I whispered the pact I’d made: “No more running. No more doubting.  
        I will climb, I will rise, I will live.”  
        The wind carried it away, but it didn’t matter.  
        That promise wasn’t for the world—it was for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I watched the sun climb higher,  
        the weight I carried for so long felt lighter.  
        A new day had come, and so had I.
