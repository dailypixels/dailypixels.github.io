      <p>
        In a narrow workshop smelling of cedar and brass oil, Haroon the clockmaker kept the town’s time alive. Generations had trusted him to fix their pocket watches, pendulums, and tower clocks. Yet his proudest work sat unfinished: a wooden clock he had begun building when his daughter was born. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Life interrupted — bills, repairs, illness — and the clock gathered dust. His daughter, Amina, grew, left for university, and wrote letters from far-off places. She always signed them with: *“Finish the clock before I come home.”* Haroon would smile, promise himself, but never quite manage.
      </p>

      <p>
        One winter, his hands trembled more than usual. He realized time — the very thing he had always measured — was slipping. He set aside other work, lit the lamp, and devoted himself to the wooden clock. He carved patiently, polished brass gears, and etched a small dedication inside: *“For Amina, who taught me that love is the truest measure of time.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        On the day Amina returned, the shop’s window glowed with lamplight. She entered to find her father waiting beside the completed clock, its pendulum swinging in perfect rhythm. Tears blurred her eyes as the chime struck softly, as though it had waited for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        The clockmaker’s promise was kept not just in wood and brass, but in the lesson he left behind: our work, like our love, becomes timeless only when we honor it with presence and devotion.
