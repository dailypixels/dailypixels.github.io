        Every morning, Laila walked past the same narrow street in Karachi on her way to work. There was a small apartment with peeling paint and a window draped with blue curtains that fluttered like waves in the sea breeze.  
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t just any window—it was her childhood home. Behind those curtains, she had once scribbled homework, argued with siblings, whispered secrets to her mother. Life had pulled her away, but the window remained like a patient guardian of forgotten days.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One afternoon, she paused. A little girl leaned out of that same window, her laughter spilling onto the street below. The curtains swayed, framing a new story, a new childhood.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Laila smiled. The house had moved on, just as she had. Some places don’t belong to us forever—they hold us for a while, then pass us to the world with love.
