      <p>
        Ten years had passed since Olivia and Nathan’s last summer together. Life had carried them across continents, leaving their hearts yearning for a connection they could never forget.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fate intervened when Olivia returned to her hometown for a friend’s wedding. She wandered to the old pier, where golden sunlight danced across the water, and there he was—Nathan, older, matured, yet instantly recognizable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Time melted as they shared stories, laughter, and memories that felt like yesterday. They walked along the shore, the waves echoing their unspoken emotions, each step bridging the gap of a decade apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nathan took Olivia’s hand, his voice trembling, “No matter the years, my heart waited for this moment.” Olivia smiled, tears glistening in her eyes, whispering back, “And mine never stopped.”  
        The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the water as they embraced, knowing that love had finally found its way home.
