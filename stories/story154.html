      <p>
        Detective Kiera had followed a series of disappearances across the city, all pointing to one narrow, graffiti-covered alley.  
        At night, the shadows seemed alive, stretching unnaturally, and whispers echoed off the brick walls.
      </p>

      <p>
        She noticed movement—a figure darting between doorways—but whenever she approached, it vanished.  
        The alley seemed to twist and elongate, as if the city itself was conspiring to hide the truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours of pursuit led her to a hidden door, slightly cracked, with faint light seeping through. Inside, she found a room filled with photographs, maps, and monitors tracking every missing person.  
        A single recording played: her own investigation, her own steps, pre-empted and watched.
      </p>

      <p>
        A voice whispered from the corner, “You’ve been part of the experiment all along.”  
        Kiera turned, realizing the figure was a mirror image of herself—exactly as she had been when first entering the alley, but controlled, observing, calculating.
      </p>

      <p>
        In that instant, Kiera understood: the alley didn’t just hide the missing—it manipulated reality itself, blurring the line between hunter and hunted.  
        As she ran, the shadows closed in, leaving her to wonder whether she had ever truly been free.
