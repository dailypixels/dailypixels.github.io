        The crew of the *Aegis* had trained for years to explore Titan’s frozen lakes. What they didn’t expect was the signal. At first, it sounded like static. Then, as their rover crossed the methane dunes, the noise formed into a rhythm—three beats, pause, three beats again.

        “It’s not random,” Dr. Lin whispered, analyzing the waves. “It’s a pattern.” The realization hung in the cabin like gravity itself. If true, they weren’t alone.
      </p>

        As night fell, Saturn’s rings cast silver light over Titan’s surface. The signal grew stronger, guiding them toward a jagged cave. Inside, crystals pulsed faintly with the same rhythm they had heard. Were these natural, or a message left behind?
      </p>

      <p>
        The crew recorded everything but agreed on one thing: humanity’s definition of “life” was about to change forever. What mattered was not the answer, but the courage to ask.
