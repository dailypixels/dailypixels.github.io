        Late at night, the library was never empty. Sophia, the night librarian, noticed books moving on their own and whispers echoing between stacks. Patrons had vanished, and the CCTV cameras captured shadows that didn’t belong to any living being.
      </p>

      <p>
        Determined to uncover the truth, Sophia followed the faint murmurs and discovered a hidden room behind the shelves. There, ancient manuscripts described a ritual that could trap memories and emotions within books, binding souls to the library for eternity.
      </p>

        As she read, shadows swirled around her, whispering fragments of stories long forgotten. Sophia realized that the library itself had become sentient, preserving knowledge but at a terrible cost. Each book contained a piece of someone’s life, willingly or unwillingly given.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, Sophia managed to escape, taking one manuscript with her. The library returned to stillness, as if nothing had happened. But she knew the shadows remained, waiting for the next curious mind daring enough to uncover their secrets.
