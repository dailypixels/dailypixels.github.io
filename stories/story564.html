      <p>
        Every spring, Arif crossed the small wooden bridge near the old tea house. And every spring, he noticed them—paper cranes tied to the railings, their colors fading with rain and wind.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one knew who hung them there. Some thought they were a prayer, others a superstition. But Arif found comfort in them.
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, as the cherry blossoms fell like pink snow, he saw her. A girl carefully tying another crane, her fingers moving as if folding hope into every crease.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re the one,” he said before he could stop himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        She looked up, startled, then smiled. “I just… leave one each year. For wishes that never find words.”
      </p>
      <p>
        That night they walked together, speaking not of dreams but of the quiet things—favorite teas, old books, the way the city smelled after rain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spring after spring, they returned. He brought a crane, she brought one too, and the bridge became a place of waiting, of gentle promises neither dared to name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until one year, Arif arrived late. Rain had soaked the bridge, and only one crane hung there—hers. Written inside: Some wishes are no longer wishes. They are answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him, footsteps.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he turned, she was there, umbrella tilted, eyes steady. He didn’t need to read the rest. The cranes had done their work.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Meaning / Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        Love doesn’t always begin with grand declarations—it can grow through rituals, patience, and shared silences. This story shows that <b>sometimes love is a wish that quietly folds itself into reality</b>.
