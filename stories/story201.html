        It had rained for days, but for Mira, the persistent drizzle mirrored the storm of memories she carried. She returned to the park where she and Ethan had shared countless rainy afternoons—laughing, talking, and dreaming under the shelter of an old oak tree.
      </p>

      <p>
        To her surprise, Ethan was there, holding an umbrella and humming the melody she remembered him playing on the piano. Their eyes met, and the years of distance and silence seemed to vanish in a heartbeat. The rain, once a backdrop to their parting, now became the rhythm of their reunion.
      </p>

      <p>
        They walked together along the winding paths, sharing stories of time spent apart, challenges faced, and lessons learned. Every laugh, every smile, and every pause carried the weight of their shared past and the tender hope of a renewed connection. It was as if the rain had washed away old doubts, leaving only clarity and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under the shelter of the oak, Ethan took Mira’s hands in his. “I never stopped thinking about you,” he whispered. Mira smiled through the drizzle, tears mingling with raindrops. “Neither did I. I just didn’t know how to find you again.” In that quiet, shared space, they rediscovered a love that distance could not dim, a bond that time could not sever.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the storm eased and the sky brightened with the first hints of sunset, they sat together, letting the soft drizzle fall around them. Mira realized that love, like the rain, could return gently, persistently, and refreshingly—bringing life, renewal, and a chance to begin anew.
