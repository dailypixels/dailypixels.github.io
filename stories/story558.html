      <p>
        When Sana returned to her hometown after a decade abroad, she barely recognized the streets. New shops had sprouted, old walls had been painted over, and the noise of the city had grown louder. Yet when she walked down the familiar path to the lake, the world grew quiet again.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bench was still there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Worn smooth by years of sun and rain, the wooden bench leaned slightly but stood strong, facing the lake’s wide expanse. Sana sat down and let the memory wash over her—afternoons of skipping stones, of sharing secrets, of laughing until her stomach hurt.
      </p>

      <p>
        She almost didn’t notice when someone sat beside her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Still your favorite spot?” a voice asked..
      </p>
      <p>
        Sana turned, her eyes widening. It was Adeel—her childhood friend, the boy who had promised her at twelve years old that no matter where they went, this bench would always be theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        They laughed at the coincidence. But as the laughter faded, comfort settled in. They caught up on lost years: the struggles, the triumphs, the regrets. Words flowed easily, like ripples spreading across the lake.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, they sat in silence, watching the sun sink into the water. The world had changed, they had changed—but the bench, the lake, the bond between them had endured.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they stood to leave, Sana touched the bench one last time. “Some promises really do last,” she whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adeel nodded, smiling. “Especially the ones you don’t forget.”
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        This story reminds us that <b>friendship is a constant,</b> even when time and distance try to fade it. The bench becomes a symbol of shared memory and resilience—showing how simple places can hold the heart of lifelong connections.
