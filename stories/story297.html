      <p>
        The old house smelled of cedar and dust — the scent of years left behind. Amelia stood in the front hall, her suitcase at her feet, gazing at the framed photos on the wall. Faces she barely remembered stared back at her. Her grandmother’s house had always felt frozen in time, and now that it belonged to her, the silence felt almost accusing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The will had been simple: *To my granddaughter Amelia, I leave the house and all within.* But the words her grandmother spoke to her years ago echoed in her mind: “There are things you mustn’t disturb upstairs, my dear. Some memories are better left asleep.”
      </p>

      <p>
        On the third night, unable to sleep, Amelia climbed to the attic. The stairs creaked as if warning her back. She pushed open the narrow door and stepped into a forgotten world — trunks, cobwebs, and a covered easel near the far window. A shaft of moonlight fell across it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Slowly, she pulled the dust cloth away. Beneath it was a portrait of a young woman, painted in rich colors — soft eyes, familiar features. The woman looked like her mother, but not quite. The plaque beneath it read: *“Margaret — 1954.”* Her mother had been born in 1958.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amelia frowned. “Who are you?” she whispered to the woman in the portrait. She began searching through the nearby trunk. Inside were letters, tied with fading blue ribbon. The first one was dated 1955, signed “Yours always, Samuel.” Samuel was her grandfather’s name.
      </p>

      <p>
        The letters told a story of forbidden love — her grandfather’s affair with a woman named Margaret, who had vanished after giving birth. The last letter ended abruptly, as if torn in half. The next paper Amelia found wasn’t a letter — it was a birth certificate. The name on it: *Margaret Ellis — Mother. Infant: Rose Whitaker.*
      </p>

      <p>
        Rose. Her mother’s name.
      </p>

      <p>
        The room seemed to tilt. Her mother had been raised as the daughter of her grandparents, not as the child of an unwed mother. The secret had been sealed for decades beneath this roof.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tears stung Amelia’s eyes as she looked again at the portrait. Margaret’s painted gaze seemed filled with sorrow, but also relief — as if waiting all these years to be seen again. Amelia whispered, “I’ll bring you back downstairs, where you belong.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning, the portrait hung in the parlor. Sunlight bathed it warmly, as if welcoming it home. Family truths could be painful, Amelia realized, but silence was a heavier inheritance.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, she sat by the fire, pen in hand, writing her own letter — not to the past, but to the future. “To those who come after me,” she began, “remember that love, even in its mistakes, deserves to be known.”
