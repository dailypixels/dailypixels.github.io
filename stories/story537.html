        Idris, a humble clockmaker, was known for repairing timepieces no one else could fix. Yet his shop 
        held a secret — an old grandfather clock in the corner that never chimed, its pendulum motionless 
        for decades. Customers assumed it was a relic, but Idris always brushed off questions with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        One stormy night, a young apprentice named Haroon accidentally wound the silent clock. To his 
        shock, it ticked — and then chimed once. That single chime echoed strangely, as though the room 
        itself shifted. Idris hurried in, pale, and stopped him from touching it again.
      </p>

      <p>
        At last, Idris confessed. The clock was built by his grandfather, who believed that time could be 
        bound to memory. Each chime carried a moment preserved — laughter of loved ones, farewells never 
        said, days lost to regret. Winding it wrong could fracture what little tethered those moments to the 
        present.
      </p>

      <p>
        Haroon begged to hear more, and Idris relented. One by one, he let the clock chime, filling the 
        workshop with ghostly voices of the past. Haroon heard Idris’s late wife singing. Idris’s eyes filled 
        with tears, but his hands trembled as he stopped the pendulum again. 
      </p>

      <p>
        “Memories must be lived, not trapped,” Idris whispered. “This clock was my family’s curse. And my 
        duty is to guard it, not use it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, after Idris’s passing, the shop closed. The grandfather clock was never found, only 
        mentioned in hushed rumors. Some say it still waits, in an attic or cellar, keeping time not of the 
        world but of the heart.
