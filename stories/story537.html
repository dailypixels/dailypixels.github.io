        When Daniel was twelve, he spent a summer at his grandmother’s crumbling estate. The house was enormous, filled with winding staircases and forgotten rooms, the kind that whispered at night when everyone else was asleep.
      </p>

      <p>
       But one room was different. At the end of the west hallway stood a door without a knob, sealed as if the house itself didn’t want it opened. Daniel asked his grandmother about it once, but her face stiffened. “That room isn’t for children. Don’t ask again
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, curiosity grew.
      </p>

      <p>
       One stormy night, a gust rattled the shutters so hard that a hidden panel beside the locked door fell loose. Inside the gap lay a rusty key. His pulse quickened as he slid it into the lock. The door opened with a sigh, as though relieved to breathe again. 
      </p>

      <p>
       The room was bare except for a single rocking chair and a stack of letters tied with string. He opened one, and his grandmother’s handwriting spilled secrets onto the page. They were letters to a sister Daniel had never heard of — a twin lost in childhood, hidden away from family stories like a shadow erased from memory.
      </p>

      <p>
       The air in the room felt heavy, but not cruel. It was grief preserved, a space where love and sorrow had been locked away together.
      </p>

<p>When Daniel showed the letters to his grandmother the next morning, she wept openly for the first time he could remember. “I thought forgetting would protect me,” she whispered. “But silence only deepens the wound.”</p>

<p>
  The door was never locked again.
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  Some truths frighten us, but hiding them only gives them power. Opening the door — whether to a memory, a grief, or a secret — can free not only the past, but also the present.
