        Detective Reyes had heard strange stories about the Baxter Hotel: Room 214 that appeared and disappeared at random. Guests swore they had stayed in it, only to return and find a blank wall where the door once was.
      </p>

      <p>
        Determined to uncover the truth, Reyes booked a night. At 2 a.m., the door appeared. Inside, the room was ordinary—except for the journal on the desk, dated decades earlier, signed by people who had never checked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, the walls pulsed as though alive. The exit vanished. The journal’s last line changed before his eyes: “Another has joined us.” Panic surged, but Reyes forced himself calm. He tore a page and shoved it into his pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        At dawn, the room was gone. He woke in the lobby chair, clutching the torn page. The journal’s words were still there—proof that the vanishing room wasn’t just a story, but a trap waiting for its next guest.
