      <p>
        There was an old wooden bench by the lake in Willow Park.  
        For most people, it was just another place to sit.  
        But for Claire and Mia, it was the heart of their friendship.  
        They had met there as children, chasing dragonflies,  
        and over the years, it became their sanctuary.
      </p>

      <p>
        They shared secrets there—first crushes, heartbreaks, fears about the future.  
        It was the bench where Claire cried when her parents divorced,  
        and where Mia swore she’d always be by her side.  
        Years later, it was where Mia confessed her dream of becoming an artist,  
        afraid the world wouldn’t take her seriously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Life carried them in different directions.  
        Claire became a nurse, working night shifts,  
        while Mia left town for art school.  
        Months turned into years, but the bench remained,  
        waiting like a patient friend for their return.
      </p>

      <p>
        One autumn evening, Claire returned to the lake.  
        She found Mia sitting there, sketchbook in hand,  
        the sunset painting the water gold.  
        Without a word, Claire sat beside her.  
        They didn’t need to explain the years apart.  
        The silence was enough, filled with the weight of everything unspoken.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, Mia turned to her with a smile.  
        “I always knew you’d come back to the bench.”  
        Claire laughed softly, her eyes wet with tears.  
        “Some promises never fade.”
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, as the stars reflected on the water,  
        they realized their friendship had never really left.  
        It had always been waiting, carved into the old wood of the bench,  
        stronger than time, distance, or change.
