    <main class="story-content">
      <p> The road to *Meadowbrook Lane* was narrower than he remembered. The trees seemed taller, the air thicker with silence. As *Elias Crane* stepped out of the cab, suitcase in hand, he saw it ‚Äî the house he‚Äôd sworn never to return to. Weathered, leaning slightly to one side, but still standing ‚Äî still waiting. </p> <p> The *House with Three Windows* had always been different. His grandfather used to say, ‚ÄúEach window holds a life. Each one shows the world the way its owner saw it.‚Äù Elias never understood what that meant as a boy ‚Äî but now, as the setting sun poured through the glass panes, each window glowed with its own color: golden, blue, and crimson. </p> <p> He unlocked the front door. The hinges sighed, dust swirling in the light. Everything was where it had always been ‚Äî the crooked clock, the wall of framed photographs, his mother‚Äôs piano untouched since her passing. He could almost hear her humming. Almost. </p>
<p><strong>The First Window ‚Äî His Grandfather‚Äôs Light (Golden)</strong>
<p> The golden window faced east ‚Äî where dawn always broke first. His grandfather had built the house after the war, brick by hand, board by board. Every morning, he‚Äôd sit by that window and polish his boots, humming songs from his youth. He believed in beginnings. He used to tell Elias, *‚ÄúEvery sunrise forgives what the night forgot.‚Äù* </p> <p> Elias touched the frame now, feeling the faint warmth of remembered mornings. He could still see the old man sitting there, eyes calm, hands steady ‚Äî a man who had lost everything yet carried peace like a flame. Elias realized he‚Äôd inherited the walls but not the wisdom. </p>
<p><strong>The Second Window ‚Äî His Mother‚Äôs View (Blue)</strong>
<p> The blue window looked west ‚Äî toward the valley, where the river ran slow and constant. His mother used to sit there every evening with her tea, sketching the world outside. She saw beauty in everything ‚Äî broken fences, stray dogs, even storms. </p> <p> When his father left, she never stopped looking out that window. ‚ÄúPeople go,‚Äù she said once, ‚Äúbut the sky always stays.‚Äù Elias had been too young to understand then ‚Äî too angry to stay. He‚Äôd run away at seventeen, chasing noise and neon lights, thinking silence meant emptiness. </p> <p> Now, as he gazed through that same window, he saw the world she saw ‚Äî quiet, imperfect, but alive. He whispered, ‚ÄúI see it now, Mom.‚Äù </p>
<p><strong>The Third Window ‚Äî His Own Reflection (Crimson)</strong>
<p> The crimson window faced south ‚Äî toward the orchard. It was his room once. As a teenager, he‚Äôd carved words into the sill: *‚ÄúI will leave this place.‚Äù* And he did. For twenty years, he built a life of movement ‚Äî new cities, new faces, never long enough to stay. </p> <p> But standing there now, he caught his reflection in the glass ‚Äî older, lonelier, softer. Behind him, the other windows glowed faintly, golden and blue, like gentle witnesses. The crimson hue from his own window painted his face like dusk over water. </p> <p> He finally understood: the house hadn‚Äôt been holding him back. It had been holding his story ‚Äî patiently waiting for him to come and finish it. </p>
<p> That night, he lit a fire in the old hearth for the first time in decades. The house creaked and settled as if sighing with relief. He played one soft note on the piano ‚Äî just one ‚Äî and it echoed through every room, gentle and forgiving. </p> <p> The next morning, when the mailman came, he found the windows open ‚Äî all three ‚Äî and Elias sitting outside on the porch steps, coffee steaming beside him, notebook open. He was writing again. Not about what he‚Äôd lost, but about what had been waiting all along. </p> <p> Years later, travelers would pass by that old house and speak of the *Three Windows of Meadowbrook*. Some said that if you looked through them at dusk, you could see three lives ‚Äî one that taught you to begin, one that taught you to forgive, and one that taught you to return. </p>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The House with Three Windows* is a story about how life keeps our memories long after we‚Äôve forgotten them. Each window represents a phase of living ‚Äî hope, love, and return. It reminds us that no matter how far we go, every journey is a circle, leading us home to where our understanding truly begins. ü™ûüè°‚ú® </p>
