      <p>
        Mia and Jordan had been best friends since childhood, their bond unshakable despite life’s ups and downs. Over the years, challenges tested them: family struggles, career pressures, and personal losses.
      </p>

      <p>
        One night, after a heavy storm, Mia called Jordan, distraught and overwhelmed. Without hesitation, Jordan grabbed an umbrella and ran through the rain to meet her friend.  
        They walked together through puddles and wind, sharing worries and offering comfort with every step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jordan reminded Mia of her strengths, the victories she had overlooked, and the resilience she had shown in past storms. Mia, in turn, listened and encouraged Jordan, realizing that their friendship was a shelter in itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time the rain subsided, the sun peeked through the clouds. They stood on a quiet street, laughing at the absurdity of the weather, feeling lighter and stronger.  
        In that moment, they understood that true friendship isn’t just about celebrating sunny days—it’s about walking together through storms, offering unwavering support and love.
