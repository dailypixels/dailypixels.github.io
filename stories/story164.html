    <p><strong>Part I: The Arrival</strong></p>

<p>Maya Patel had always loved cities — the noise, the anonymity, the rhythm. When she moved into the mid-century apartment building on Harland Avenue, it seemed perfect: quiet, affordable, with a view of the skyline. Apartment 12A. Neat, sunlit, and hers.</p>

<p>Her neighbor, a kind elderly woman named Mrs. Klein, welcomed her with cookies and a smile. “You’ll like it here,” she said. “Everyone keeps to themselves. Mostly.”</p>

<p>Mostly.</p>

<p>That word stayed with her, though she didn’t think much of it — not until the mail began arriving. Thick envelopes, handwritten, addressed to *Mr. Alan Vance, Apartment 12B.*</p>

<p>At first, she assumed it was a simple mistake. But when she went next door to deliver them, she found the door sealed shut. The peephole was dark, and the nameplate had been removed.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part II: The Man Who Wasn’t There</strong></p>

<p>“No one’s lived there for years,” said the building manager, a man named Russo. “12B’s vacant.”</p>

<p>“Then why is he still getting mail?” Maya asked.</p>

<p>He shrugged. “Old tenants. People forget to update addresses. Happens all the time.”</p>

<p>But that night, as she passed 12B, she heard something — faint, rhythmic. A soft *tapping* from inside. Three knocks. A pause. Then two more. Her heart skipped. She pressed her ear to the door. Silence.</p>

<p>She told herself it was the pipes. Old buildings made sounds. But when she returned to her apartment, another envelope was slipped beneath her door — this one unaddressed. Inside was a single sheet of paper, typed in bold black ink:</p>

<p><em>“Stop asking about 12B.”</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part III: The File</strong></p>

<p>Maya couldn’t let it go. The next morning, she went to the local post office and asked about the sender’s addresses. The clerk frowned. “Funny thing,” he said, flipping through his records. “Those return addresses don’t exist.”</p>

<p>Back home, she searched the building’s public records. There it was: *Alan Vance — tenant from 2015 to 2018.* The notes ended abruptly. “Evicted — no forwarding address.”</p>

<p>She felt something was missing, like a page had been torn from history. That night, she heard the tapping again. This time, it came from the wall behind her bed — the shared wall with 12B.</p>

<p>Three knocks. Pause. Two knocks.</p>

<p>Her breath quickened. “Who’s there?” she whispered.</p>

<p>Silence. Then a faint voice — a man’s voice — almost a whisper through the plaster:</p>

<p>“Don’t trust Russo.”</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part IV: What Lies Behind the Wall</strong></p>

<p>The next morning, she confronted the manager. “Who is Alan Vance?”</p>

<p>Russo’s eyes hardened. “I told you — no one’s lived there in years.”</p>

<p>“Then why did someone speak to me through the wall?”</p>

<p>He leaned closer, voice low. “Walls have memories, Miss Patel. Some are better left alone.”</p>

<p>That night, unable to sleep, she returned to the hallway with a flashlight. The door to 12B stood slightly open.</p>

<p>Her heart pounded. She pushed it gently. The room beyond was empty — stripped bare. No furniture, no lights. Just dust. But on one wall, scrawled in faded ink, were words that chilled her blood:</p>

<p><em>“They erased me.”</em></p>

<p>On the floor lay a small cassette tape labeled *A.V. — 12B.*</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part V: The Recording</strong></p>

<p>She played it on an old tape deck. A man’s voice, trembling: “If you’re hearing this, they’ll try to find you. The manager isn’t who he says he is. This building — it isn’t apartments. It’s a test site. They erase tenants. Records. Memory. I was next. I escaped, but not far.”</p>

<p>The tape ended abruptly with the sound of knocking — three, pause, two.</p>

<p>Maya froze. The same rhythm. The same warning.</p>

<p>She ran to her door — but it wouldn’t open. The lock had been changed. From outside, she heard footsteps. Heavy. Slow. Someone stopped right outside her apartment.</p>

<p>Then, from behind the wall — the voice again, urgent now:</p>

<p>“Get out through the window!”</p>

<p>She didn’t hesitate. She climbed down the fire escape, the cassette still clutched in her hand. When she looked back, she saw a light flicker on in 12B — and a figure standing in the window. Watching.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part VI: The Missing Tenant</strong></p>

<p>The next morning, police arrived to search the building. Apartment 12B was bricked over — no door, no window, no record of it ever existing. Russo was gone. No one in the building remembered a tenant named Maya Patel.</p>

<p>But at the post office a week later, a new letter arrived — handwritten, stamped, addressed to *Alan Vance, Apartment 12B.*</p>

<p>The return name: *Maya Patel.*</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Man in Apartment 12B</em> explores paranoia, erasure, and the fragility of truth. It reminds us how easily people — and memories — can disappear when no one is watching. Sometimes, the scariest mysteries aren’t about ghosts, but about the things the world chooses to forget. 🩸</p>
