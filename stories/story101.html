      <p>
        Every morning, Liam laced up his boots and stared at the steep mountain trail  
        near his home. For months, the climb had seemed impossible, each step heavier than the last.  
        Doubt whispered that he wasn’t ready, that the summit was beyond reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, a stranger joined him at the base of the trail.  
        “The climb isn’t about the peak,” the stranger said, “it’s about the courage to keep moving forward.”  
        Liam took the advice to heart, focusing not on the distance left but on the step beneath his foot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step by step, he pressed on. Some days were grueling; the path slippery and exhausting.  
        Yet, he discovered that persistence built strength, and every small victory—every step forward—mattered more than he realized.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks later, standing atop the summit, Liam realized the mountain hadn’t changed—he had.  
        The view was breathtaking, yes, but the real reward was understanding that courage, consistency, and self-belief  
        are what allow us to rise above the challenges we once thought impossible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The climb taught him that every daunting journey begins with a single step,  
        and that the weight of a step is never as heavy as the regret of never taking it.
