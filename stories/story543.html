      <p>
        In a crumbling apartment block, an odd window caught tenants’ eyes. It had once looked out onto the street but had been bricked shut decades ago. Still, Mrs. Patel, who lived in the flat, placed a chair before it every morning, sipping tea as though gazing at a view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neighbors whispered — some said she had lost her sight, others that she was waiting for someone who never came. But one evening she explained to a curious child: “I don’t need the view. I imagine one. Trees swaying, children laughing, skies always blue. A window is not what you see, it’s what you believe is beyond it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who heard her words, the bricked-up window became less strange. It became a reminder that hope does not need a clear path — only a frame to rest upon.
