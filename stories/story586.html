      <p>
  I found it by accident — a river with no name on any map.  
  <br><br>
  It curved through the valley like a silver scar, quiet and wide, as if it had forgotten how to speak.  
  <br>
  The villagers said it used to sing, that once its waters carried the laughter of those who lived beside it. But now, they said, it had gone silent.
</p>

<p>
  I walked along its bank for miles, camera in hand, though I didn’t take a single picture.  
  <br>
  Something about the stillness felt sacred — not the emptiness of loss, but the fullness of pause.  
  <br>
  Every ripple seemed to wait for something — a word, a memory, a voice.
</p>

<p>
  By dusk, I reached a bend where the reeds grew taller than me. There, half-buried in mud, was a stone marker etched with faint letters.  
  <br>
  I washed it clean with river water, and slowly, the name appeared: <em>“Asha.”</em>  
  <br>
  Hope. That was what the river had once been called.
</p>

<p>
  I whispered it aloud — and the wind rose.  
  <br>
  The surface of the water rippled, small waves rushing toward me as if answering a call long forgotten.  
  <br>
  The sound came next — soft, low, like a sigh becoming a song.  
  <br>
  It was the sound of memory returning home.
</p>

<p>
  That night, I camped beside it, unable to sleep.  
  <br>
  I heard the river whisper — not in words, but in rhythm, a pulse that matched my own heartbeat.  
  <br>
  I realized it wasn’t the river that had forgotten its name — it was we who had stopped listening.
</p>

<p>
  At dawn, I placed my notebook on a stone and wrote just one line:  
  <br>
  “Names are not lost — they only wait to be remembered.”  
  <br>
  When I looked up, the current carried my reflection away, and for the first time, the river seemed alive again.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
  The River That Forgot Its Name reminds us that nature never truly forgets — it waits.  
  When we slow down enough to listen, even silence begins to sing again.
