      <p>
        Harper and Sam had grown up in a coastal town, spending summers exploring the cliffs and waves. When Harper faced a personal crisis that threatened to pull him under, Sam refused to let him face it alone.

        They became “lighthouse keepers” for each other, a metaphor for guidance and stability. Nights were spent talking by the shore, offering advice, encouragement, and laughter. Harper’s burdens felt lighter with Sam’s unwavering presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        One stormy evening, a call came: a stranded boat in the dark waters. Harper and Sam rushed to the lighthouse, signaling the way with its powerful beam. Together, they helped the sailors find safety. The experience reminded Harper that friendship is a beacon in the darkest times.
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing atop the lighthouse after the storm, Harper turned to Sam and said, “You’ve been my light when I couldn’t see the path.” Sam smiled, “And you’ve been mine. That’s what friends do.”  
        In that moment, they realized that true friendship is both shelter and guidance, shaping lives through unwavering support.
