        The violin sat in its case, silent for months. Lila had lost the courage to play after repeated failures, judging herself too harshly. But one rainy evening, drawn by memory, she opened the case and lifted the instrument. Her fingers trembled.

      <p>
        She began to play slowly, each note hesitant at first, but gradually filling the room with warmth. Mistakes came, yet they didn’t stop her. She realized music wasn’t perfection—it was expression, persistence, and courage to continue despite fear.  
      </p>

      </p>
