      <p>
        The legend of the Lost Canyon had lived in maps  
        and whispers for centuries.  
        Locals said its walls echoed with voices of travelers  
        who never returned.  
        That was exactly why Ava and Marcus had come.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their backpacks were heavy with ropes, water,  
        and notebooks filled with rough sketches.  
        The path into the canyon was narrow,  
        sunlight swallowed by towering cliffs.  
        At every step, the air grew colder,  
        though it was midday outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you hear that?” Marcus asked.  
        Ava stopped.  
        It wasn’t wind.  
        It was laughter—faint, hollow,  
        bouncing against stone walls.  
        She gripped the map tighter.  
        The inked trail ended exactly where they stood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours passed as they descended deeper,  
        chasing the sound.  
        They discovered carvings in the rock—  
        symbols older than the villages nearby.  
        At the center of the canyon lay a river,  
        black as obsidian and flowing without a source.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Ava dipped her hand into the water.  
        Ripples formed shapes—faces of strangers,  
        eyes wide with warning.  
        She yanked her hand back,  
        heart hammering.  
        Marcus whispered, “This place remembers.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        They stayed until dusk,  
        sketching, documenting,  
        and fighting the growing urge to flee.  
        As the first stars appeared,  
        they heard the echoes again—  
        but this time, the voices spoke their names.
      </p>

      <p>
        Terrified, they climbed out under the cover of night.  
        Neither spoke a word until they reached camp.  
        The canyon lay silent behind them,  
        holding its secrets close.  
        Yet they both knew:  
        their names now belonged to the legend.
