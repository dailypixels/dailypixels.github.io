     <p> Every autumn, *Elara* returned to the same park, to the same maple tree. Its leaves turned the color of sunset — the same color as the paper of the letters she used to send to *Rowan.* </p> <p> They met in a small university town by accident — she was sketching the old clock tower, he was photographing the sky. Their conversations were short, awkward, but filled with a strange gravity. When Rowan left for an overseas job, they promised to write letters, not emails. “Real words,” he said. “Something that can outlive the internet.” </p> <p> And so, every month, she wrote. She told him about the changing seasons, her art shows, the smell of rain on cobblestone. But no replies came. One year passed. Then two. Then five. The world changed — people stopped writing letters — but Elara didn’t stop. She kept writing into the silence, believing somehow the words would find him. </p> <p> On the tenth autumn, while cleaning the attic of her late parents’ house, she found an old, unopened box marked *“Return Mail — Dead Letters.”* Her heart froze. Inside were dozens of her own envelopes, perfectly sealed, never opened, all stamped *“Address Not Found.”* </p> <p> Shaking, she picked one up — the last she had written. It was dated exactly ten years ago, to the day. She opened it with trembling fingers. Her words were simple: <em>“If you ever read this, I’ll be waiting beneath the maple tree. Every year, until the last leaf falls.”</em> </p> <p> Tears blurred the ink. She went back to the park that evening, the air thick with the scent of dying leaves. The bench was still there. But this time, there was something resting on it — a stack of letters bound with a string. The handwriting on top was unmistakable. Rowan’s. </p> <p> The first line read: <em>“Elara, I never stopped writing. But I sent them to the only address I remembered — your childhood home.”</em> </p> <p> Beneath the last letter, one more note was tucked, newer than the rest, dated just two days ago: <em>“I’m here now, beneath the maple tree.”</em> </p> <p> She turned — and there he was, standing under the golden branches, the autumn wind moving softly between them like a sigh of time. </p>
<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Letters Beneath the Maple Tree* reminds us that love can survive even through lost years and missed chances. Sometimes the universe holds our words until both hearts are ready to receive them. In a world obsessed with instant replies, it is patience that becomes the most faithful language of love. 🍂💌 </p>
