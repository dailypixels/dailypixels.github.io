        In the bottom drawer of her desk, Leena kept a stack of letters she had never sent. Some were apologies, some confessions of love, others reflections she never dared to share. Each page carried a piece of her heart frozen in ink, waiting for a recipient who might never read them.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One evening, curiosity pulled her back to the drawer. She unfolded the oldest letter, written to a childhood friend she lost touch with. Reading her own words, she realized the letters were less about others and more about herself—they were milestones of growth, witnesses of feelings she once thought unbearable.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Slowly, she read them all. By the end, tears stained her cheeks, not of regret but of release. She didn’t need to send them anymore. The act of writing had already healed her. Each letter had been a mirror of her soul, teaching her that expression itself is therapy.  
      </p>
      <p>
        That night, she tied the stack neatly and placed it back in the drawer—not as unfinished business, but as proof of how far she had come. Some words need no audience; they simply need to be written.
