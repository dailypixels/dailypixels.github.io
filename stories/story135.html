      <p>
        Years apart had left their mark, but not their love.  
        Emma had moved across the country for work, while James stayed behind, leaving their story suspended in memories and unsent letters.
      </p>

      <p>
        One quiet evening, Emma returned to the old cobblestone street where they had first met.  
        A lantern flickered, illuminating a bundle of letters tied with a ribbon—letters she had written but never sent, waiting for him at the corner cafe.
      </p>

      <p>
        James was already there, holding a matching set of letters he had never mailed.  
        Their eyes met, and the years of longing, regrets, and unspoken words melted away in an instant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sitting beneath the lantern, they read each other’s letters aloud, laughing, crying, and discovering that despite distance and time, their hearts had never truly parted.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time the street lights reflected on the wet cobblestones, Emma and James had rekindled a love that was patient, enduring, and beautifully resilient.  
        They realized that some connections are destined to reunite, no matter the years that try to separate them.
