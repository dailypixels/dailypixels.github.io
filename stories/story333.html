        When Hannah agreed to bake her niece’s birthday cake, she underestimated two things: the complexity of a triple-layer rainbow sponge, and the mischievousness of her cat, Pickles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Flour coated the counters like fresh snow. Food coloring exploded across the walls. Pickles leapt onto the batter bowl, sending it spinning like a UFO. By the time Hannah pulled the lopsided creation from the oven, it looked more like modern art than dessert.
      </p>

        At the party, she braced for disappointment. But the children erupted in laughter, declaring it “the funniest cake ever.” Her niece crowned her “the best baker in the world,” while Pickles prowled proudly as though he’d helped.
      </p>

        The disaster became legend in the family—proof that sometimes, the best memories come from chaos and a cat’s paw print in the icing.
