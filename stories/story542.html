      <p>
        Commander Elin Zhou had spent six months aboard the orbital station Solace. Routine checks, daily reports, silence. Space was vast, but the work was small.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came the anomaly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her console blinked at 03:17 hours. A narrowband transmission, encrypted, repeating every eleven seconds. It wasn’t from Earth. Not from any known satellite. Not from any mapped trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she decoded it, a single phrase emerged:
      </p>
<p>
“<b>Do not come home.</b>”
</p>
<p>
At first, she thought it was a prank, a stray signal bouncing through space. But over the next nights, the messages grew. Coordinates. Warnings. Snippets of her own voice reading system logs she hadn’t written yet.
</p>
<p>
Panicked, she contacted Mission Control. They dismissed it as interference. Yet hours later, the station lights flickered, and for the briefest moment, she saw her reflection in the glass — older, scarred, eyes hollow with years she hadn’t lived.
</p>
<p>
She followed the coordinates anyway. The signal led her to a fragment of debris orbiting high above the planet: a ruined satellite, centuries beyond current design. Inside its data core was a log signed with her name.
</p>
<p>
The final entry read:
</p>
<p>
“We sent this back because Earth is no longer safe. The silence you hear on the ground is not peace — it is aftermath. If you land, you will never rise again. Keep the stars. Stay away.”
</p>
<p>
Her hands shook as Earth rotated below, blue and fragile. Home had never felt so close — or so unreachable.
</p>
<p>
As the transmission looped one last time, Elin understood. It wasn’t a warning from strangers. It was her own voice, echoing back from a timeline that had already ended.
</p>
<p>
She turned off the re-entry systems. Alone above a dying world, she whispered into the void: “Then I will carry the silence for us all.”
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  This story reflects on how the future can warn us, but choice remains in the present — between comfort and survival, between returning to what’s known and venturing into the unknown.
