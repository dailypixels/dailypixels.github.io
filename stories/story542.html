        In the heart of Lahore’s walled city, Yusuf sat at his workbench, stitching pages with hands weathered by forty years of craft. He was the last master bookbinder in the quarter, carrying techniques his father had taught him — methods no machine could replicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customers now came rarely, preferring sleek digital devices. Yet Yusuf persisted, believing that books breathed differently when bound by hand. Each spine he stitched was an act of defiance against forgetting.
      </p>
      <p>
        One afternoon, a young woman brought in a diary belonging to her grandmother. The pages were falling apart, ink nearly vanished. Yusuf worked for days, repairing each leaf, pressing it into new leather. When she returned, she held the diary as if it were her grandmother’s hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Will anyone remember this craft when you’re gone?” she asked softly. Yusuf smiled. “Only if people like you keep bringing stories worth saving.” His words lingered, a quiet challenge against a fading world.
