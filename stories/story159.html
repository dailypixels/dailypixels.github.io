        After years apart, Sophie returned to her hometown for the holidays, unsure if she would see Liam again. Memories of laughter, late-night talks, and first love flooded back with every familiar street.

        At the town square, adorned with festive lights and falling snow, she spotted him—Liam, holding a cup of cocoa, frozen in the moment as if time had waited for them.  
        Their eyes met, hearts racing, bridging years of distance with a single look.
      </p>

        They walked together beneath the glow of the holiday decorations, talking, laughing, and sharing stories of the paths they had taken separately. The cold air couldn’t touch the warmth growing between them.

        As snowflakes fell gently around them, Liam took Sophie’s hand and whispered, “No matter how far we drifted, I never stopped hoping for this moment.”  
        Sophie smiled, tears of joy mingling with the snow, knowing that their reunion was not just a moment, but the start of a renewed love.
