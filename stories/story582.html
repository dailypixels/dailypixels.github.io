      <p>He met me in silence.</p>
<p>The studio smelled of turpentine and forgotten dreams. Canvases leaned against the wall like mute witnesses. Outside, the morning light struggled through half-closed blinds, painting the dust in gold.</p>
<p>“You came to ask about the colors,” he said finally, voice low and hoarse. “Everyone does.”</p>
<p>His name was Yusuf Rahman — a name that once echoed in galleries from Karachi to Paris. They used to call him <em>The Man Who Painted Light.</em> But now, his hands trembled when they reached for a cup of tea, not a brush.</p>
<p>“I didn’t forget how to paint,” he continued. “I just forgot why.”</p>
<p>I asked him what he meant. He smiled, the kind of smile that doesn’t reach the eyes. “When you pour your soul into colors for too long, one day you wake up and realize — there’s nothing left to pour.”</p>
<p>He walked to a covered canvas and pulled the sheet away. It wasn’t a painting at all — just a blank surface. White. Untouched. Infinite.</p>
<p>“This,” he whispered, “is my masterpiece. It reminds me of everything I lost... and everything I still have the courage to remember.”</p>
<p>Before leaving, I noticed a faint smear of blue on his thumb. Fresh. Wet.</p>
<p>When I turned back, the canvas wasn’t blank anymore. A single brushstroke of morning sky cut through the white — trembling, alive.</p>

<h2><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong></h2>
<p>Some artists stop creating not because they lose talent, but because they lose themselves in what they create.
Yusuf’s silence was his canvas — and his single stroke was a confession: that art can begin again, even after forgetting every color.</p>
