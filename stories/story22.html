        The station was nearly silent, save for the hum of a vending machine and the faint squeak of rats somewhere in the shadows.  
        I clutched my ticket tightly—“Platform 3, Last Train, 11:58 PM.” There were no announcements, no staff, no other passengers.  
        Just me, and the dim glow of the clock ticking toward midnight.
      </p>

      <p>
        The train screeched into view right on time, its headlights piercing through the fog.  
        The doors slid open with a hiss, revealing an empty carriage. I hesitated for a moment, then stepped inside.  
        The smell of steel and rain filled the air as I sank into a worn leather seat near the window.
      </p>

      <p>
        The train jolted forward, gliding through a city swallowed by darkness.  
        Streetlights flickered outside, but I couldn’t make out the shapes of buildings—just shadows,  
        blurring together as if the city had been erased.  
        I checked my phone: no signal. The battery icon flashed red.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the next stop, an old man in a tattered coat stepped in.  
        He sat across from me, clutching a briefcase that looked older than him.  
        He smiled faintly, his eyes tired.  
        “You’re taking the last train,” he said softly. “Not many do.”  
        I nodded awkwardly, unsure what to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stop after stop, more passengers boarded—silent figures, their faces pale and distant.  
        A woman in a wedding dress. A boy clutching a broken toy.  
        A man in a firefighter’s uniform, his helmet resting in his lap.  
        None of them spoke. They simply stared out the windows into the black void rushing past.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Strange night,” I whispered to the old man.  
        He turned to me slowly, his voice gentle. “It always is. The first night is the hardest.”  
        I frowned. “First night of what?”  
        He didn’t answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        The train began to slow. The conductor’s voice finally crackled over the intercom:  
        “Next stop, Last Stop.” His tone was calm, almost reverent.  
        The old man stood, motioning for me to follow. “It’s time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I stepped off the train onto a platform bathed in golden light.  
        The air was warm, and I could hear faint music in the distance, like a lullaby.  
        The old man gestured to a long staircase leading upward.  
        “You’ll be alright,” he said softly. “We all get here eventually.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Confused, I turned back to the train, but it was already gone. The platform was empty.  
        Slowly, it dawned on me. I didn’t remember buying the ticket.  
        I didn’t remember leaving my apartment.  
        I didn’t even remember how I got to the station.
      </p>

      <p>
        My heart pounded as I looked toward the glowing staircase.  
        And then I remembered the crash—the sound of screeching tires, the blinding headlights,  
        the silence that followed.  
        I took a shaky breath, wiped my tears, and started climbing.
