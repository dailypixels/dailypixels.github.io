      <p>
        Ethan and Liam had shared countless adventures, from childhood tree forts to late-night talks by the lake.  
        Yet life pulled them in different directions—Ethan pursued a career overseas, while Liam stayed to care for his family.  
        Despite the distance, their bond remained steadfast.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Ethan returned unexpectedly, he found Liam struggling with self-doubt after a failed business venture.  
        Without hesitation, Ethan spent weeks helping his friend rebuild—not just the business, but his confidence and spirit.  
        Together, they tackled challenges, shared victories, and reminded each other of the power of mutual support.
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening, they walked along the old dock where they had spent so many nights dreaming about the future.  
        Liam turned to Ethan and said, “No matter where life takes us, we’ll always anchor each other.”  
        Ethan smiled, realizing that friendship isn’t about constant presence, but about unwavering reliability when it matters most.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their journey together reminded them that life’s burdens feel lighter when carried with someone who understands,  
        and that true friends become the compass guiding each other through storms and calm alike.
