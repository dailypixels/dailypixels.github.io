     <p>They said the Silver Grove sang only once every thousand years — when the moonlight struck its heart just right, and the world stood still to listen. But to Elara, a young bard with trembling hands and a cracked lute, it was only a legend her grandmother whispered beside the fire.</p>

<p>Until the night the stars began to fall.</p>

<p>She found herself in the forest, drawn by a low hum that vibrated through her bones — not sound, but memory. The trees glowed faintly, their silver leaves shivering as if in anticipation. At the grove’s center stood the Heartwood Tree, ancient and luminous, its roots coiled around a stone altar.</p>

<p>A voice — clear, sorrowful — echoed through the clearing. <em>“Child of song, bearer of silence. Why have you come?”</em></p>

<p>Elara bowed her head. “Because the world is dying,” she said. “The rivers run black, the skies have forgotten blue, and every song I sing falls empty.”</p>

<p>The air thickened, and from the roots emerged a figure woven from bark and light — the Guardian of the Grove. Its eyes glowed with centuries of wisdom and grief. <em>“The song of life has been broken,”</em> it said. <em>“Only the pure of heart can restore it. But know this — to sing it, you must give what you cherish most.”</em></p>

<p>Elara’s hands tightened around her lute. “What must I give?”</p>

<p>The Guardian touched her chest. <em>“Your voice.”</em></p>

<p>She staggered back. “My voice is all I have.”</p>

<p>“Then give it,” the Guardian said gently, “and all may yet live.”</p>

<p>Elara looked around her — at the shimmering forest, the faint echoes of songs that once filled the air. She thought of her grandmother, of the stories that had kept hope alive when the world grew cold. With trembling fingers, she raised her lute and began to play.</p>

<p>The first note was small, fragile — then the forest answered. Light spiraled from the trees, dancing through the branches as her melody rose higher, weaving through the stars themselves. Her voice followed — pure, radiant — until it cracked the night apart like dawn.</p>

<p>The earth quaked. The Heartwood Tree began to bloom, its petals unfolding like silver fire. Rivers ran clear once more, the skies bled blue, and the stars burned anew.</p>

<p>When the final chord faded, Elara fell to her knees, her voice gone — but the grove sang in her place. Every leaf whispered her name. The Guardian knelt before her, placing a single silver blossom in her hands.</p>

<p>“You have restored the Song,” it said. “And though your voice is silent, the world will never forget its echo.”</p>

<p>Years later, travelers who passed through the Silver Grove spoke of a soft hum carried on the wind — the sound of a girl’s song, keeping the forest alive.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Song of the Silver Grove</em> is a story about selflessness, legacy, and the courage to create even when it costs everything. It reminds us that true art — like love — often asks for sacrifice, but its echo can heal what words alone never could. 🌙🎶</p>
