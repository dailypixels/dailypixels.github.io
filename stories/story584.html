        Aaliya found an old loom in her grandmother’s attic and began weaving again, as her ancestors had. Each thread represented a memory, a choice, or an emotion, intertwining to create patterns that reflected her own journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process of weaving became therapeutic, helping her confront unresolved grief and misunderstandings with family. Conversations with her parents and siblings gradually mended the frayed connections, much like threads being carefully tied together.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end, Aaliya realized that life’s threads are fragile yet resilient. Healing requires patience, care, and attention to small details. The tapestry she completed symbolized forgiveness, growth, and the enduring power of family.
