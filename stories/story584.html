      <p> 
        The shop sat at the end of a forgotten alley — a place where time seemed to hold its breath. <br><br> Inside, hundreds of clocks surrounded me. Some ticked in perfect rhythm; others stood still, their hands frozen mid-moment. <br> Behind a wooden counter, the clockmaker sat, his spectacles glinting in the lamplight, his fingers moving with patient grace. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
        “You must be here for the story,” he said softly. “People come, write about the man who fixes time.” <br> I smiled. “It’s a rare art. The world moves too fast for it.” <br> He chuckled, winding a tiny gear. “That’s because they mistake motion for progress.” 
      </p>
       <p>
         On the wall behind him hung a silver pocket watch — cracked glass, stopped at **3:17**. <br> “Why not repair that one?” I asked. <br> His hands stilled. For a moment, only the sound of ticking filled the air. <br> “Because that’s when she left,” he said quietly. “If I fix it, I’ll have to let her go forward too.” 
        </p>
         <p> 
          He opened the watch, revealing a faded photograph of a woman with kind eyes. “My wife. She used to say time was our love language — I built the hours, she filled them.” <br> His voice trembled. “When she died, all the clocks stopped for a second. I kept them running. All but one.” 
        </p>
         <p> 
          I looked around at the ticking army — each clock a heartbeat he had chosen to keep alive. <br> “So you keep fixing time for others,” I said, “but not for yourself.” <br> He smiled faintly. “Maybe that’s the only way to remember — by letting one hour stay broken.” 
        </p> 
        <p>
           As I left, the bells struck midnight. But in his workshop, one clock remained still, faithful to 3:17 — the moment love became eternal. 
          </p> 
          <p> 
            <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> Time heals, but it also holds. The Clockmaker’s Heart reminds us that some moments aren’t meant to be repaired — they’re meant to be remembered.
