      <p>
        In a small mountain village, Laila’s grandmother still worked at the old wooden loom. Tourists bought factory-made rugs in the cities, but her hands continued weaving patterns passed down for centuries.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Each thread is a story,” she told Laila, guiding her fingers across the loom. “When you forget the pattern, you forget who you are.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Laila once dreamed of leaving the village, but watching her grandmother’s quiet persistence changed her. She began recording the stories behind each design—spirals that meant journeys, diamonds that meant protection, borders that meant belonging.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, when the loom finally fell silent, Laila turned those stories into books and exhibitions. The threads remained unbroken, weaving the old into the new.
