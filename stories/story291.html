      <p>It was nearly midnight when Nora first heard it — a faint scraping sound from the apartment across the hall. She froze mid-step, the hallway light flickering above her. Apartment 3B had been empty for months. She knew because she lived alone in 3A, and she’d seen the realtor lock it up herself.</p>

<p>The noise came again — slow, deliberate. Something metallic dragging across the floor.</p>

<p>“Probably the pipes,” she whispered to herself, forcing a laugh. But when she pressed her ear against her door, she could hear the soft thud of footsteps pacing. Then a whisper. Too faint to make out, but too human to mistake.</p>

<p>Over the next few nights, the sounds grew bolder. A door opening. A chair moving. A faint hum of a tune she didn’t recognize. Nora began leaving her TV on just to drown it out. Yet every time she turned the volume down, she could hear the humming again — closer, clearer.</p>

<p>Finally, after three nights of sleeplessness, she couldn’t take it anymore. She crossed the hallway barefoot, heart pounding, and tried the handle of 3B. It didn’t move. The lock was sealed tight, dust still caked around the frame. But as she leaned closer, she caught it — the unmistakable scent of smoke and something metallic, like rust… or blood.</p>

<p>“Hello?” she whispered. No answer. Only silence — deep, waiting silence.</p>

<p>She backed away, breath shallow, when the door handle twitched. Just once. Then stopped.</p>

<p>Nora fled inside her own apartment, bolting the locks and calling the landlord. “There’s someone in 3B,” she said. But he sighed. “Impossible. The place’s been vacant since January. There’s no power, no water, no lease.”</p>

<p>That night, the humming returned — but now it was inside her walls. She traced the sound to the vent above her bed. When she peered into the grate with a flashlight, something glimmered back. A human eye.</p>

<p>She screamed and stumbled back. The light flickered out. The vent went silent.</p>

<p>By the time police arrived, Apartment 3B was empty — clean, untouched, the dust undisturbed. But in Nora’s apartment, they found something strange. Behind her wall, the insulation had been removed, forming a narrow tunnel that connected the two units.</p>

<p>And inside the tunnel, they found a mattress. A blanket. Empty food wrappers. And a wall covered in photographs — all of them of Nora, taken through her own windows.</p>

<p>The police told her the squatter must’ve been hiding there for weeks, maybe months. They never caught him. The entry point was sealed, the apartment re-rented, and life went on.</p>

<p>But sometimes, when the nights are quiet and the hallway lights begin to flicker, the new tenants of 3A say they still hear it — a faint hum through the vent, slow and steady, like someone remembering a song they used to sing.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Apartment Across the Hall</em> explores how fear often hides in the ordinary — a door, a sound, a silence we convince ourselves isn’t real. It reminds us that true terror isn’t what we see, but what watches us back. 🔦🚪</p>
