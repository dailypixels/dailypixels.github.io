      <p>
        Sophie had discovered a box of letters tucked away in her attic—letters she and Liam had exchanged years ago when distance had forced them apart. Each envelope carried memories of their love, dreams they had shared, and confessions that time had made bittersweet. Holding them, she felt a rush of emotions she hadn’t expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a quiet afternoon, she decided to find Liam. He had moved across the country, and years of silence had left them strangers in some ways, yet their hearts still held echoes of what they once shared. When she finally saw him sitting on a park bench, letters in hand, time seemed to collapse, and the years melted away.
      </p>

      <p>
        They spent hours reading the letters aloud, laughing at their youthful expressions, crying at moments of longing, and reminiscing about memories that had shaped their journey. Every word reminded them of the depth of their connection and the love that had endured despite time and distance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liam took Sophie’s hand gently. “All these letters… I never forgot a single word,” he said. Sophie smiled, tears glistening. “And I always hoped we’d find each other again.” Their reunion wasn’t just a meeting of past lovers—it was a reconnection of souls, a recognition that true love can survive even the longest separations.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the sun began to set, casting golden light across the park, they walked together, letters safely tucked away but their emotions fully expressed. Letters from the Past had guided them back to each other, proving that love, when genuine, never fades—it simply waits for hearts to be ready to embrace it once more.
