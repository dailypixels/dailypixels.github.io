      <p>
        As children, Laila and her cousin Hassan spent every monsoon folding paper boats and floating them 
        across the flooded streets of their village. They believed each boat carried a wish, and together they 
        dreamed of building a “bridge of paper boats” strong enough to cross any storm.
      </p>

      <p>
        But storms of another kind came. Hassan left to work abroad, sending money but rarely letters. Laila 
        stayed, raising her siblings after their parents’ passing. Decades slipped by. The paper bridge of their 
        childhood became a memory half-forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>
        One monsoon, in her fifties, Laila stood by the river. She saw children playing with paper boats, their 
        laughter echoing her own past. Tears welled up as she whispered, “We never built our bridge, Hassan.”
      </p>

      <p>
        A week later, a parcel arrived: hundreds of folded boats, carefully varnished to withstand water, each 
        carrying Hassan’s handwriting — apologies, blessings, memories, and one final promise:  
        *“The bridge was never paper, Laila. It was the bond we kept alive through everything.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        That monsoon, the villagers joined Laila in floating the boats across the swollen river. They didn’t 
        build a bridge of paper, but a bridge of love, laughter, and remembrance that spanned not only the 
        river but the years of distance.
