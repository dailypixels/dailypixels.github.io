      <p>
        On the first day of fourth grade, Max forgot his lunch. He sat alone on the playground bench, stomach growling, watching everyone else unwrap sandwiches and chips.
      </p>

      <p>
       Then Mia plopped down beside him, unwrapping a giant peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Without hesitation, she tore it in half and shoved the bigger piece into his hands. “Rule number one,” she said, “friends never starve alone.”
      </p>

      <p>
        From that day on, they invented the Sandwich Pact. Whoever forgot lunch, the other would share, no matter how small the sandwich. Tuna, ham, egg salad, or even the dreaded cucumber experiment — split down the middle.
      </p>

      <p>
        By high school, the pact had expanded to fries, milkshakes, and even math homework (though their teacher wasn’t amused). In college, it was midnight pizza slices and emergency coffee before exams.
      </p>

      <p>
      Years later, at Mia’s wedding, Max raised his glass and said, “To the bride — the only person I’d trust to cut a sandwich evenly… even though she never once did.” The room burst into laughter, and Mia grinned, because she had always taken the bigger half — but Max had never minded
      </p>

<p>
  It wasn’t about the sandwich. It was about the promise: whatever we have, we share.
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  Friendship isn’t measured in grand gestures, but in the small, consistent ways we show up for each other — even if it’s just half a sandwich.
