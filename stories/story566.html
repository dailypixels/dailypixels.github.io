      <p>
        When Ayan and Rida were twelve, they planted a sapling in the meadow at the edge of town. It was no taller than their knees, its leaves trembling in the breeze. They promised to meet there every summer, no matter what.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first few years, they kept their promise—sharing lemonade, gossip, and secret hopes beneath its shade. But life pulled them apart. High school, university, jobs in different cities. The sapling grew; their friendship seemed to shrink.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years passed before Ayan returned. The meadow was wilder now, but the tree stood tall, branches heavy with green. He touched the trunk—and saw their initials carved faintly into the bark, almost lost to time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Still standing,” he murmured.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Of course,” came a voice behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rida. Her smile was older, softer, but still hers. She carried two cups of lemonade. They laughed at how much had changed—and how much hadn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        They sat beneath the tree, the same as before, though the branches stretched higher now, offering a stronger shade. Words came slowly at first, then freely, like roots rediscovering the soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the sun dipped low, Ayan carved one more mark into the bark: the date. Beside it, Rida added: We kept our promise.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Meaning / Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        Friendship, like a tree, doesn’t need constant tending to survive—it just needs strong roots. This story reminds us that <b>the bonds we plant in sincerity can weather time, distance, and change, and still stand tall when we return</b>.
