        The year was 1632, when Lahore’s bazaars glowed with silk, spices, and the hum of artisans whose work fed the empire’s grandeur. Among them lived Rahim, a quiet weaver who spent his days hunched over a handloom in a modest stall near Delhi Gate.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was known not for wealth but for detail—the way his patterns told stories hidden in cloth. While nobles demanded carpets of power and merchants sought exotic colors, Rahim wove something different: memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each thread, dyed in crimson or gold, carried fragments of his people’s lives—the laughter of children, the grief of mothers, the songs of wandering qawwals. His loom was his diary, and every shawl he made was stitched with more than silk: it held resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        But whispers grew louder in the city. Taxes tightened, wars drained coffers, and artisans were forced to surrender their best work for paltry sums. Some abandoned their looms. Rahim refused.
      </p>
       <p>
        One winter night, soldiers stormed through, demanding tribute. They pointed to his half-finished shawl. “This belongs to the emperor now,” one barked. While nobles demanded carpets of power and merchants sought exotic colors, Rahim wove something different: memory.
      </p>
       <p>
        Rahim’s hands shook, but his voice did not. “No, this belongs to Lahore.” While nobles demanded carpets of power and merchants sought exotic colors, Rahim wove something different: memory.
      </p>
       <p>
        The soldiers laughed, leaving him bruised but alive, the loom shattered. Yet even in ruin, Rahim gathered his scattered threads. Slowly, painstakingly, he rebuilt. The shawl would never be sold; instead, he gave it to the mosque near the Shahi Hammam, where it still hung long after Rahim’s death. While nobles demanded carpets of power and merchants sought exotic colors, Rahim wove something different: memory.
      </p>
       <p>
        Years later, travelers wrote of it—a shawl unlike any other, woven with dignity, defiance, and a people’s story.
      </p>

      <h>Meaning / Reflection</h>

      <p>
        The Weaver of Lahore reminds us that history is not only written in palaces and battles—it is also woven into the humble hands of those who refuse to let their craft, culture, and identity be erased. True legacy lies in what survives the empire, not what serves it.
