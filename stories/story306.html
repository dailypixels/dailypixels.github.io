    <main class="story-content">
     
<p>Milo was a perfectly average housecat with perfectly average ambitions: sleep, eat, knock things over, repeat.</p>
<p>His human, Sarah, was a journalist constantly glued to her laptop. One night, while she typed frantically about politics, Milo stepped on her keyboard. Twice.</p>
<p>Submit.</p>
<p>The next morning, news channels screamed one headline:</p>
<p><strong>“Mystery Candidate M. Paws Running for President!”</strong></p>
<p>Sarah choked on her cereal.</p>
<p>Milo sat on the table licking his paw, pleased by the chaos he created.</p>
<p>The campaign office called within minutes.</p>
<p>“We want to schedule a press conference with Mr. Paws.”</p>
<p>Sarah tried explaining he was literally a cat, but the scheduler interpreted “meow” as “statement pending.”</p>
<p>By noon, Milo wore a tie and sat behind microphones.</p>
<p>A reporter asked, “What is your stance on economic reform?”</p>
<p>Milo stared into the crowd, then batted the microphone off the podium.</p>
<p>The nation roared with applause.</p>
<p>“He rejects corruption!” someone shouted.<br>
“He demands change!” another yelled.<br>
“He is Paws for the People!” chanted the crowd.</p>
<p>Milo purred</p>
<p>His popularity exploded. His top promises included:</p>
<p>• More naps for all citizens<br>
• Mandatory tuna breaks<br>
• Laser pointer entertainment in every workplace<br>
• Free cardboard boxes delivered to every home</p>
<p>People loved him. Dogs felt deeply confused.</p>
<p>Other candidates tried to compete, but none could match Milo’s charisma. During a debate, when an opponent accused him of being inexperienced, Milo simply yawned and showed his belly.</p>
<p>The audience melted.</p>
<p>“He is so honest,” they whispered.</p>
<p>The polls revealed the impossible: Milo might win.</p>
<p>The night before the election, Sarah sat with Milo on the couch.</p>
<p>“You have changed everything,” she sighed. “Are you ready to lead the country?”</p>
<p>Milo blinked.</p>
<p>Then he coughed up a hairball on her shoes.</p>
<p>Election day arrived.</p>
<p>Millions voted.</p>
<p>The final announcement stunned the world:</p>
<p><strong>“President M. Paws wins by a landslide!”</strong></p>
<p>Confetti exploded. Milo received the golden collar of office. His first executive order declared:</p>
<p><strong>National Nap Time at 2 p.m. daily.</strong></p>
<p>Productivity crashed. Happiness soared.</p>
<p>During his inaugural speech, Milo said absolutely nothing. Everyone clapped anyway.</p>
<p>On day two, Milo demanded the red laser pointer be declared a national threat after he noticed it never let him catch it.</p>
<p>The economy fell apart, but morale was sky-high.</p>
<p>Milo now rules from his White House scratching post, occasionally passing laws by stepping on papers.</p>
<p>His approval rating remains 100 percent among cats and 45 percent among confused humans.</p>
<p>Some say destiny chooses leaders.</p>
<p>Others say never let a cat near a keyboard.</p>
<p>Both can be correct.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning & Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Life becomes better when people stop taking everything so seriously. Joy, laughter, and a little absurdity remind us that happiness matters as much as progress. Sometimes leadership requires claws, naps, and not caring what anyone thinks.</p>
