        The town square glowed with life as families gathered, holding paper lanterns painted with wishes and prayers. Children laughed, elders shared stories, and the scent of spiced tea filled the cold December air. The Lantern Festival had returned after years of silence.

        For Noor, it was her first time. She wrote on her lantern: *“Let me find strength to start again.”* Grief had weighed heavily on her heart since her father’s passing, but tonight, surrounded by neighbors, she felt less alone.
