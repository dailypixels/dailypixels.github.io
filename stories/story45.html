        The station clock ticked past midnight, echoing through the empty terminal.  
        The last train north was late, and so was she.  
        I sat on the cold bench, jacket pulled tight, trying not to notice  
        the man in the far corner staring too long at his phone…  
        or was it me he was watching?
      </p>

      <p>
        A metallic hum cut through the silence.  
        The train screeched into the station,  
        its headlights slicing through the fog.  
        The doors opened. No one got off.
      </p>

      <p>
        My phone buzzed: *Don’t get on.*  
        Unknown number.  
        I froze. The man in the corner stood,  
        slipping something into his pocket as he walked toward me.  
        His footsteps echoed louder than they should have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instinct shoved me toward the train.  
        The doors hissed shut behind me,  
        and I ducked into the first empty car.  
        Except… it wasn’t empty.  
        A woman sat by the window,  
        her hands folded neatly in her lap,  
        eyes wide with something between fear and recognition.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You got the message too?” she whispered.  
        The train lurched forward. The lights flickered.  
        Then the intercom crackled,  
        and a calm voice spoke:  
        *“No one is getting off this train.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        The doors between cars sealed shut with a clang.  
        That’s when I realized:  
        We weren’t heading north.  
        We weren’t heading anywhere I’d seen on a map.
