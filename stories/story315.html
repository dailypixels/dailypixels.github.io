<p>Detective Marlon Hayes had seen enough corruption to fill a lifetime. Still, nothing prepared him for the crime scene behind the old courthouse.</p>
<p>A body slumped against graffiti-covered bricks. No phone. No ID. No wallet. Only one object left deliberately beside him:</p>
<p>A <strong>small black ledger</strong> marked with the symbol of a chess knight.</p>
<p>Inside, Marlon found a list of names. Politicians. CEOs. Judges. Each name with a date. Most were crossed out in red ink.</p>
<p>Harper Vance, billionaire developer, was next.</p>
<p>Marlon’s instincts screamed that this notebook was never meant to be found. Someone was sending a message.</p>
<p>He rushed to Harper Vance’s penthouse. Security was tight. Cameras everywhere. Vance refused protection, laughing off the threat.</p>
<p>“Detective, no one controls me. Certainly not petty criminals with notebooks.”</p>
<p>Marlon left frustrated, but not defeated.</p>
<p>That night, the news broke:</p>
<p>Harper Vance found dead in his private elevator. “Accidental” fall.</p>
<p>Another red cross would soon be inked.</p>
<p>The ledger had predicted a murder. It would predict more.</p>
<p>Marlon returned to his precinct. He ran background checks on every name. All of them had escaped charges in major criminal cases over the years. Untouchable. Above the law.</p>
<p>Someone was changing that.</p>
<p>Marlon confided in his captain.<br>
<strong>“We</strong>’re dealing with a vigilante network. Strategic. Deadly. They know everything about the people on this list.”</p>
<p>His captain eyed him with strange caution.<br>
“You should hand that ledger over. Immediately.”</p>
