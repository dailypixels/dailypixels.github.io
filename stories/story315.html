        Legends said the Elderwood sang once every century, and those who heard its melody would glimpse their true destiny. Most dismissed the tale as folklore, but Arin, a wandering bard, believed otherwise. With his lute strapped to his back, he ventured into the ancient forest on the eve of the hundredth year.

        The trees whispered as he walked, their leaves rustling like a chorus. At the heart of the forest, a clearing glowed with emerald light. Arin played his lute softly, hoping to coax the melody out. Then it came—not from him, but from the forest itself. The ground vibrated, the branches hummed, and a song unlike any mortal tune filled the air.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the music, Arin saw visions: a kingdom torn by war, a queen in need of counsel, and a bard who could turn sorrow into hope. The song wasn’t just beauty—it was a summons.
      </p>

      <p>
        As dawn broke, the music faded, leaving Arin trembling. He knew his life would never be the same. The forest had given him a calling: to carry its song into the world and heal what was broken.
