      <p>It was her last night on air.</p>

<p>Mara adjusted the dusty microphone and stared at the clock on the studio wall. Midnight. The hour of farewells. Outside, the rain whispered against the glass as if the world, too, were listening.</p>

<p>For thirty years, she had hosted <em>Echoes of the Heart</em> — a show that once filled the airwaves with laughter, confessions, and the warmth of strangers’ stories. But tonight’s guest was different. This time, the voice she was about to interview belonged to a ghost — at least, that’s what people said.</p>

<p>Her name was Laila Noor — the singer who disappeared after her last concert in 1985. No one ever found her. Only her songs remained, fragile and eternal.</p>

<p>When the red light blinked on, Mara spoke softly: “Laila, can you hear me?”</p>

<p>There was silence. Then, a faint hum — an old melody floating through the static.</p>

<p>“I never stopped singing,” the voice answered at last, trembling like wind through curtains. “I just... changed stages.”</p>

<p>Mara’s breath caught. She recognized that tone — rich, melancholic, human. “Where are you now?” she asked, her hands shaking slightly over the control board.</p>

<p>“Everywhere people still remember my songs,” Laila replied. “I live in the moments when someone hums an old verse without realizing why. In the echoes of applause that never really fade.”</p>

<p>Mara leaned closer, whispering, “Why did you leave?”</p>

<p>“Because fame takes your voice and turns it into an echo,” Laila said. “I wanted to be a person again — not a performance.”</p>

<p>The sound wavered, growing distant. The static rose. And then, a final whisper came through: “Thank you for listening.”</p>

<p>The red light blinked off. Silence reclaimed the booth.</p>

<p>When Mara checked the recorder later, there was nothing. No voice. No music. Only the sound of her own heartbeat and rain on glass. Yet somehow, when she played the outro, an old melody filled the air — one she had never loaded.</p>

<p>Laila Noor’s voice had returned for one last song.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
Some stories are not meant to be proven — only heard.  
Mara’s final broadcast reminds us that art, like love, never truly vanishes.  
Even when voices fade, their echoes keep us company in the silence we leave behind.</p>
