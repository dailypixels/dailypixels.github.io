        When Mariam’s younger brother fell gravely ill, the hospital room became a place of silence, broken only by the beeping of machines. She felt helpless, unable to change his pain. One day, her grandmother told her an old legend: folding a thousand paper cranes could grant a wish.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Mariam began folding. At first clumsy, her cranes were wrinkled, uneven. But as the days stretched on, she grew faster, more careful. Each crane became a silent prayer—of health, of laughter, of mornings without fear.  
      </p>

        Nurses paused at the doorway, moved by the growing flock of colorful birds taped along the walls. Visitors left paper squares on her table, joining in. Soon the room transformed into a sanctuary of hope, filled with fluttering wings.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Her brother smiled one morning, the first in weeks, pointing to the ceiling covered in cranes. “They look like they’re flying me home,” he whispered. Slowly, he recovered, and though doctors credited medicine, Mariam believed the cranes carried faith stronger than any prescription.  
      </p>

      <p>
        A thousand cranes could not change fate, but they changed hearts. They proved that even in despair, hands could build hope one fold at a time.
