        I had passed that little café a hundred times.  
        It was ordinary—just brick walls, wooden tables,  
        and a chalkboard menu out front.  
        But that morning, something pulled me inside.  
      </p>

      <p>
        She was there, sitting by the window,  
        stirring her coffee absentmindedly,  
        her eyes lost in a book.  
        A strand of hair kept falling across her face,  
        and every time she tucked it behind her ear,  
        I found myself smiling without reason.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t believe in fate.  
        Or at least, I didn’t—until she looked up.  
        Her gaze met mine, and for a second  
        the clatter of cups, the chatter of voices,  
        even the sound of rain against the glass disappeared.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I ordered coffee just to have a reason to stay.  
        When the barista called my name,  
        she laughed softly—  
        because it was the same as the character in her book.  
      </p>

      <p>
        We started talking.  
        About the weather, about books, about nothing and everything.  
        The coffee went cold, but neither of us cared.  
      </p>

      <p>
        A week later, we met again.  
        And again.  
        The café on the corner became ours.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Years from now, people will ask us  
        where it all began.  
        And we’ll smile, holding hands,  
        and say:  
        <em>“Just a little café on the corner.”</em>
