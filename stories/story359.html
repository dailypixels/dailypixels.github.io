        The storm had raged for hours, relentless waves battering the small sailboat. Arjun gripped the tiller, heart pounding, salt stinging his eyes. Every instinct screamed to turn back, to seek safety, but he remembered his father’s words: *“Courage isn’t the absence of fear, it’s acting despite it.”*

      <p>
        Hours blurred into night. Lightning split the sky, thunder shook the mast, yet he pressed forward. Each wave conquered was a testament to his perseverance, a declaration that he refused to be defined by circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        When dawn finally broke, the sea calmed, and Arjun saw the horizon open before him. Exhausted but alive, he understood the storm had not broken him; it had revealed the strength he carried all along. True courage is discovered in the heart of the storm, and he had found it.
