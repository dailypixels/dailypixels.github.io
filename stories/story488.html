        In the hospital’s night canteen, the fluorescent lights hummed and the coffee machine gurgled, but the air tasted of tired patience. Nurses exchanged quick smiles; janitors moved in slow, careful sweeps. On a Tuesday during a long winter, a delivery arrived — but not for patients.
      </p>

      <p>
        A small florist from down the street, who sold posies by day, began a quiet project: every night, while the city slept, she placed a simple bunch of flowers on the benches of the night shift canteen. No note, no fanfare — just a small bouquet wrapped in brown paper, left for the unseen workers who kept the hospital breathing after dark.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, the bouquets were surprises: a nurse stopped in her tracks and inhaled, then laughed; a security guard tucked a stem behind his ear. Word spread in quiet tones. The night staff started arriving earlier, not for the flowers themselves, but for the small human reminder that someone noticed them. They began to share stories: who had a child graduating, who needed a bedtime story for a worried neighbor, who had not been home in days.
      </p>

        On a particularly harsh night, when the ICU overflowed and tempers frayed, a tray of flowers was placed in the middle of a huddled team meeting. A doctor took a stem and, with a humor-broken voice, said: “We will do the best we can, for these flowers and for each other.” The moment shifted something — a shared breath, a gentle recommitment to work done with compassion.
      </p>

        Months later, the night florist announced she would retire her stall. The night staff gathered and surprised her with a bouquet that filled her entire modest shop. The florist cried, saying she had only wanted to remind people they were seen. They replied: “You reminded us we are not alone.” Her small gestures had grown into a network of care — people leaving notes, baking loaves, and covering shifts. The flowers had been the spark.
      </p>

        The hospital kept a small vase of night-shift flowers as a tradition. It reminded everyone that the smallest kindness — unticketed, unpaid, and unannounced — can reshape the culture of a place and return hope to those who need it most.
