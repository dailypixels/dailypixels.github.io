        In the bustling bazaars of Lahore, old clocks were fading relics, replaced by digital time. Yet Yusuf, the last clockmaker on Anarkali Street, kept his tiny shop alive. Each clock ticked with stories—weddings, inheritances, goodbyes.

        One afternoon, a young boy entered carrying a broken pocket watch. “It was my grandfather’s,” he said. Yusuf examined it, noticing the inscription inside: <em>“Keep your promises, and time will keep you.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The boy returned daily, watching Yusuf work with steady hands. Finally, the watch ticked again, soft but sure. “Why fix these old things?” the boy asked. Yusuf smiled: “Because memory is not measured in hours, but in what we honor.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Decades later, that boy—now a man—would inherit Yusuf’s shop. The last clockmaker was gone, but the promise lived on, ticking gently through the generations.
