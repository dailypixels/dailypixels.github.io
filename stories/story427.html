        The Last Café was more than just a place to sip coffee. For over twenty years, it had been a haven for lovers, friends, and lonely souls seeking connection. Its walls were covered with photos, notes, and sketches left by patrons.  
      </p>

        Rania, a young writer, had spent countless afternoons here, notebook open, pen moving, inspired by the hum of life around her. But news came: the café would close at the end of the month.  
      </p>
      <p>
        On her last visit, Rania wandered from corner to corner, touching the worn table edges, inhaling the scent of roasted beans, and smiling at memories of laughter, quiet tears, and first meetings. She realized that places aren’t just brick and mortar—they are vessels of human stories, and even when they close, those stories linger in hearts.  
      </p>

        The café’s owner, Mr. Hasan, handed her a small box of letters left by regulars. Each one was a time capsule of lives intersecting in fleeting, meaningful ways. Rania promised herself she would carry the essence of The Last Café into her writing, keeping the warmth alive for everyone who had ever stepped inside.
