      <p>
        Olivia and Sam had been friends since high school, navigating life’s ups and downs side by side.  
        When Sam faced a career setback and lost confidence, Olivia decided to help him rediscover his strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        They started small—morning walks, shared coffees, and conversations about dreams and fears.  
        Olivia reminded Sam that progress isn’t measured by leaps, but by the small, consistent steps taken together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the weeks, Sam regained his confidence.  
        He took on new projects, reconnected with old passions, and slowly rebuilt the courage he had lost.  
        Olivia celebrated every milestone, showing that friendship thrives in support, patience, and encouragement.
      </p>

      <p>
        One afternoon, while hiking their favorite trail, they paused at the top to watch the sunset.  
        Sam turned to Olivia and said, “I couldn’t have done this without you.”  
        She smiled, knowing that friendship is not just about being present for the easy moments,  
        but about walking with someone through the hard ones too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, they realized that life’s journey is brighter, lighter, and more meaningful when steps are taken side by side.  
        Their friendship, strengthened by trials and care, became an inspiration to face life’s challenges with courage and hope.
