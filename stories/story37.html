      <p>
        The city was quiet, for once. From the rooftop, I could see a thousand twinkling windows,  
        each one holding a story, a life, a world I’d never know.  
        Above it all, stars blinked shyly through the haze, like tiny promises that tomorrow might be better.

        I came up here when life felt too heavy. Tonight, the weight in my chest had been suffocating.  
        Work was chaos, the news relentless, and my own thoughts louder than I liked to admit.  
        So I climbed the rusted fire escape, breathless but grateful for the stillness that greeted me at the top.
      </p>

      <p>
        A soft breeze carried the smell of rain. Somewhere below, a street performer was playing guitar,  
        the gentle melody floating through the night air like a lullaby for the whole city.  
        I sat on the ledge, hugged my knees, and just… breathed.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s when I noticed a flicker of light across the way. A small balcony, just two buildings over,  
        and a girl about my age standing there, looking up at the same stars. She raised a hand, hesitated,  
        then waved. I waved back, surprised by how much that small gesture warmed me.
      </p>

      <p>
        We didn’t speak, not even a word. But for a few minutes, the loneliness I’d carried all day dissolved,  
        replaced by something fragile and beautiful: connection. It reminded me that, in this city of millions,  
        I wasn’t really alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the night deepened, the rain finally came, soft and refreshing. I stayed there, drenched but smiling,  
        letting the cool drops wash away the heaviness of the day. The world was still imperfect,  
        but in that moment, it felt okay. Hope, I realized, was a lot like these stars—  
        even when hidden, it was always there, waiting for the clouds to pass.
