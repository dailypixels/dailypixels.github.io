      <p>
        Mei had attended the lantern festival every year with her grandmother.  
        After her grandmother passed away, Mei almost skipped it, afraid the empty space beside her would hurt too much.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when the night arrived, she found herself in the crowd, clutching a single lantern.  
        Around her, families whispered wishes into the night before releasing their glowing prayers skyward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mei lit her lantern, whispering: *“Thank you for your love. Guide me still.”*  
        As it rose, a warmth filled her heart, as though her grandmother’s presence drifted upward with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Watching thousands of lanterns float into the heavens, Mei realized: love never vanishes. It transforms—into light, into memory, into guidance that carries us forward.
