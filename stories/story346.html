        In the checkout line, a young boy placed candy bars on the counter, fumbling with a handful of coins.  
        The cashier shook her head gently. “You’re short, sweetheart.”  
        His face fell, eyes glistening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behind him, an older woman quietly added a dollar. The boy’s smile returned instantly.  
        “Thank you,” he whispered, clutching the candy as if it were treasure.
      </p>

        His mother explained they were struggling, but the kindness of strangers had become their safety net.  
        The woman nodded and said, “We’ve all been helped before. Now it’s my turn.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Watching the exchange, others in line softened. A stranger paid for the mother’s groceries. Another offered her a ride home.  
        What began as a small act rippled into many, proving that kindness is contagious.
      </p>

      <p>
        That grocery aisle became a reminder: one small coin of compassion can multiply into wealth the world truly needs.
