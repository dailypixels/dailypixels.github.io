        The lighthouse stood at the edge of the cliffs like a sentinel, its white tower glowing in the fading light. 
        Locals said it had been abandoned for decades, but as we approached, I swore I saw a light flicker behind the glass.

        My sister Emma laughed it off, clutching her scarf against the biting wind. “Probably just the sunset,” she said. 
        But even she slowed her pace as we reached the rusted gate, the sound of waves crashing below echoing like distant thunder.
      </p>

        Inside, the air smelled of salt and rust. The spiral staircase groaned under our steps as we climbed, our flashlight beams 
        dancing over peeling paint and broken lanterns. And then we heard it—a whisper, faint but clear, carried on the wind. 
        My heart skipped. We weren’t alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the top, we found not a ghost but a journal, weathered and water-stained, lying open on a table. 
        The final entry was dated fifty years ago: *“If anyone finds this, know that the storm took everything but her voice. 
        She still sings to warn them.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        We stood there in silence, listening. And through the roar of the ocean, we heard it—a haunting melody carried by the wind. 
        We didn’t stay long. By the time we reached the cliffs again, the lighthouse was dark, and I couldn’t help but glance back, 
        wondering if the whispers would follow us home.
