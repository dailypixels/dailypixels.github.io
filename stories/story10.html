    <main class="story-content">
      <p> The rain came early that year — soft, hesitant drops against the café window. For **Hira**, it was just another grey afternoon in Lahore. She sat by the glass, sketchbook open, waiting for a client who’d promised to arrive at 3 p.m. sharp. But as the clock struck three, the doorbell chimed — and it wasn’t her client who walked in. It was **Sarmad**. </p> <p> Time seemed to pause. He looked the same — a little older, maybe, his hair thinner, his smile quieter. But it was him. The man she had once promised to wait for. The man who’d left without saying goodbye. </p> <p> For a moment, neither moved. Only the sound of rain filled the silence, like an old memory returning from the corners of their hearts. </p> <p> “Do you mind if I sit?” Sarmad asked softly, pointing to the chair across from her. She nodded, wordless. The chair scraped against the floor — the same sound it had made that last night, eight years ago, when he’d stood up to leave. </p> <p> The waiter brought two cups of coffee — one black, one with cream — without being asked. He remembered them. Everyone here did. This café had been theirs. </p> <p> “You still draw?” he asked, trying to sound casual. “Sometimes,” she replied, closing the sketchbook. “You still run away?” He looked down, a faint smile tugging at his lips. “Touché.” </p> <p> The rain grew heavier, blurring the world outside. It was as if the city wanted to hide them — give them one more moment in a place untouched by time. </p> <p> Hira finally broke the silence. “Why now, Sarmad? After all these years?” He hesitated, searching for the right words. “Because the rain started,” he said finally. “And when it rains, I remember you.” </p> <p> She laughed softly — a broken, beautiful sound. “Do you remember the letters too?” “I kept them all,” he said. “Every single one.” He pulled a small bundle of old, folded papers from his coat pocket. The ink had faded, but her handwriting danced across each page like it had never left him. </p> <p> “I used to read them when things got hard,” he said. “When I was in London, alone, trying to convince myself I’d done the right thing by letting you go.” </p> <p> Her eyes softened. “And did you?” He shook his head. “No. I didn’t. I told myself I left because I didn’t want to hold you back. But the truth is, I was afraid you’d see who I really was — and stop loving me.” </p> <p> For a long time, she said nothing. Then she whispered, “I never stopped.” </p> <p> The words hung in the air — fragile, trembling, like the raindrops racing down the window. He reached across the table, his hand brushing hers. The warmth was familiar. It was home. </p> <p> Outside, the rain slowed. The city glowed with that soft, golden light that always comes after a storm. It felt like forgiveness. Like the world exhaling after holding its breath for too long. </p> <p> They didn’t promise anything this time. No vows, no forever. Just silence, and two steaming cups of coffee, and a letter that no longer needed to be sent. </p> <p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *When the Rain Remembered Us* is a story about unfinished love that finds its ending not in grand gestures — but in quiet understanding. Some hearts don’t need to start over. They just need to be seen again, in the rain that never forgot them. ☔ </p>
