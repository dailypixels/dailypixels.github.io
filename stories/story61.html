      <p>
        The old oak tree had stood at the edge of Willow Creek for over a hundred years. 
        Generations of children carved their initials into its bark, lovers shared their first 
        kisses beneath its branches, and travelers found shade in the summer heat. 
        For Emma and Daniel, it was the place where their story began.
      </p>

      <p>
        They first met there as teenagers, both seeking refuge from a storm. 
        Emma, with her sketchbook clutched tightly against her chest, and Daniel, 
        holding a guitar case that looked far too big for his shoulders. 
        A bolt of lightning had startled her, and he had offered a smile that felt 
        warmer than the blanket of summer rain surrounding them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, the oak became their meeting place. 
        Sometimes for laughter, sometimes for tears. 
        He would play soft melodies while she sketched the world around them. 
        Their dreams grew like the branches above—stretching, intertwining, 
        reaching for something higher than themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Life, however, is not always kind to young love. 
        College sent them in different directions: Emma to the city for art school, 
        Daniel to another state chasing music. 
        Letters turned into emails, emails into occasional texts, and then silence. 
        Still, the oak tree remained—a silent witness to promises whispered 
        but never forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ten years later, Emma returned to Willow Creek. 
        The town looked smaller, quieter, but the oak tree stood the same, 
        tall and unwavering. She walked toward it, her heart heavy with memories, 
        unsure why she had come. Perhaps to close a chapter. 
        Perhaps to find something she lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        As she touched the bark, she noticed something new carved just below 
        their faded initials: *“Still waiting—D.”*  
        Her breath caught. She turned, and there he was. 
        Older, yes. A few lines near his eyes, a hint of gray near his temples. 
        But his smile—his smile was exactly as she remembered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neither spoke at first. 
        Then Daniel broke the silence with a soft laugh.  
        “I thought maybe one day you’d come back here.”  
        Emma’s eyes filled with tears. “And you waited?”  
        “Some love,” he whispered, stepping closer, “is worth the wait.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Beneath the oak tree, they found each other again. 
        Not as the restless dreamers they once were, 
        but as two souls who had walked their own roads 
        only to end up in the same place, at the same time, 
        beneath the branches that had always known their story.
