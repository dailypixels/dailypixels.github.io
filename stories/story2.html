    <main class="story-content">
      <p> The train screeched to a halt in the middle of the night. Through the window, **Elias Grant** saw nothing but fog. He’d been traveling across the countryside for days — running from a life that had begun to feel like an echo. </p> <p> The sign outside the window was strange. It was an old wooden board, cracked and pale, with no letters — as if the name had been erased by time itself. Curiosity tugged at him, and before he could think, Elias stepped off the train. </p> <p> The moment his shoes touched the platform, the fog thickened — soft, alive, whispering. A single lantern flickered beside an empty ticket booth. And on the bench nearby sat a woman in a long, grey coat. She looked up, smiled faintly, and said, “You’re early this time.” </p> <p> Elias froze. He had never seen her before — yet her voice was familiar. He sat beside her, and she handed him a cup of steaming tea. The silence between them stretched like a thread. Finally, he asked, “Where am I?” </p> <p> She turned to him. “Between destinations,” she said. “Some people pass through here when they’ve forgotten where they were going.” </p> <p> The train behind him hissed, impatient. He stood, confused. “And if I don’t get back on?” Her eyes softened. “Then you’ll remember what you were running from.” </p> <p> The whistle blew. Elias hesitated — then stepped back onto the train. As it moved away, he turned to look one last time, but the platform had vanished. Only fog remained — and a faint echo of a woman’s voice saying, “Until next time.” </p> <p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong> Every journey has pauses that are not on the map — moments where time stops so the soul can catch up. Some stations aren’t meant to be found — only remembered. </p>
