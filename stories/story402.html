      <p>
        In the crowded night market, lanterns glowed like stars pulled down from the heavens. Each one was hand-crafted by Yusuf, a lantern maker whose calloused fingers stitched light into paper and wood. He had done this for forty years, ever since his father taught him.  
      </p>

      <p>
        His daughter, Aisha, watched him silently from the stall. She loved the way his hands moved, though she worried for him—his eyesight was fading, and his business was slowing as electric lights became more popular. She often wondered if this ancient craft had a future.  
      </p>

      <p>
        One winter, Yusuf fell ill. Customers came less often. Aisha picked up the tools, remembering how he had once guided her hands as a child. At first her lanterns were crooked, uneven. But with practice, she found rhythm—her father’s rhythm—flowing through her.  
      </p>

      <p>
        She began creating new designs: lanterns shaped like birds, stars, and stories. People noticed. Tourists asked to buy them. Soon, her lanterns carried both tradition and innovation, blending the old with the new.  
      </p>

        When Yusuf recovered, he sat by the stall, watching his daughter’s work glow brighter than his own. With tears in his eyes, he whispered, “Light was never meant to stay in one hand—it must be passed on.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        Aisha smiled, realizing the lanterns had become more than light—they were love, memory, and the bond between generations.
