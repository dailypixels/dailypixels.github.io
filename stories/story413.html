      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Mountain, how do you remain so steadfast through storms?  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Patience, young one. I do not move with every wind. I endure. I listen. Every storm teaches me, shapes me, but does not define me.  
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> And what about those who climb you? How should they face their fears?  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Step by step. Fear is part of the journey. Each footfall is progress. Sometimes, the path is hidden, sometimes rocky—but the summit rewards courage and perseverance.  
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> What do you wish humans would understand?  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> That strength is not always shown by speed or might. True strength is quiet, consistent, and enduring. Listen to the world, and it will guide you.  
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end, Zain understood: the mountain was more than rock. It was wisdom, resilience, and humility embodied. And he left its shadow forever changed, carrying patience in his heart.
