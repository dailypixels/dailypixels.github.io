    <main class="story-content">
      <p> In the forgotten city of *Aurevale*, where the river met the desert, lived a woman named <em>Lyra Senne</em>. She was a glassmaker — not of bottles or windows, but of wonders. Her shop overflowed with crystal birds that sang when sunlight touched them, vases that bloomed with light, and mirrors that whispered faintly when no one was near. </p>

<p> Lyra had not spoken to anyone in years. Her husband, <em>Calen</em>, had vanished during a storm that swallowed half the city’s coast. Ever since, she had poured her grief into her craft, shaping the silence into shimmering forms. The townsfolk said her creations were too lifelike, as if souls lingered within them. </p>

<p> One moonless night, while repairing a cracked mirror, Lyra noticed something impossible. The reflection was wrong. Her workshop was empty — but in the mirror’s depth, a figure stood, watching her. It was Calen. </p>

<p> She stumbled back, heart racing. The figure lifted a hand, and the mirror rippled like water. His voice, distant but tender, echoed through the glass. “The world beyond is breaking, Lyra. You must come before it fades.” </p>

<p> Against all reason, she touched the surface. The mirror melted beneath her fingers, and she was pulled through. On the other side stretched a vast garden made entirely of glass — trees of crystal, rivers of molten light, petals that rang like chimes when they fell. It was beautiful, but fragile. </p>

<p> Calen stood beneath a shining archway. “This is the <em>Garden of Glass</em>,” he said. “The place where lost souls go when the world forgets them. I built it for us, but it’s dying. Every time someone clings too long to sorrow, a piece of it fades.” </p>

<p> Lyra looked around. The sky itself was cracking, pieces of twilight shattering into dust. “Then let me help you fix it,” she said. </p>

<p> Together, they shaped new forms — bridges of mirrored flame, flowers of breath and memory. Yet with every creation, Lyra felt her own body growing colder, more transparent. Calen’s smile grew fainter. “To stay,” he whispered, “you must let go of the life waiting beyond the glass.” </p>

<p> She hesitated. Outside, there was nothing — only her empty shop and the sea’s silence. But as she held Calen’s hand, she saw her reflection in his eyes: not the woman she had lost, but the woman she could become. </p>

<p> The next morning, the people of Aurevale found her workshop filled with light. The mirror that had cracked was whole again, though something shimmered behind it — a vision of a garden alive with color. In the center, two figures stood hand in hand, their faces calm, their eyes eternal. </p>

<p> The townsfolk kept the mirror safe, saying that on quiet nights, when grief felt heavy, the glass hummed softly — reminding them that love, even when it’s gone, leaves behind its own kind of magic. </p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
*The Garden of Glass* is a story about healing and acceptance — how beauty can be born from loss, and how love does not end, it transforms. Sometimes, we must break our reflection to see who we truly are. 🪞✨ </p>
