      <p>
        The old stone bridge at the edge of the city was the kind of place no one visited after dark. Children grew up on stories of shadows that lingered there, whispers rising from the water as though the river carried secrets no one should hear. Most dismissed it as superstition, yet the bridge had a way of keeping its silence heavy and its history hidden.
      </p>

      <p>
        One autumn evening, a university student named Hira decided to test the legend. Armed with only her recorder and notebook, she walked across the bridge just as the lamps flickered on. The city’s hum faded behind her, replaced by the low murmur of the current below. She stopped midway and waited.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, nothing. Then faint voices, overlapping, drifting up like threads of forgotten conversations. Hira froze. The recorder captured fragments—names, pleas, warnings. When she reviewed them later, the voices didn’t sound like echoes of the living, but of those who had once crossed and never returned.
      </p>

      <p>
        Digging into archives, Hira discovered that decades earlier, political prisoners were marched across that bridge at night and “disappeared” into the river. The whispers weren’t myth; they were memory refusing to be erased.
      </p>

      <p>
        From then on, Hira returned weekly, placing flowers at the railing. She no longer feared the whispers—she honored them. And in doing so, she transformed the bridge from a place of dread into one of remembrance.
