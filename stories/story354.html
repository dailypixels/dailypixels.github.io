        Clara sits across from me, a warm smile that lights up the small café. She has built a nonprofit bringing music education to underprivileged children. I start with the obvious question: “Why music?”  
      </p>

      <p>
        “Music saved me when I was young,” she says softly. “I lived in a neighborhood where hope was scarce. The piano in our community center became my escape, my voice, and eventually my purpose.”
      </p>

      <p>
        We talk for hours. She shares stories of children learning their first notes, of tears and laughter, of quiet moments when she realized she had created not just lessons, but confidence, dreams, and sanctuary.
      </p>

      <p>
        “People ask me about impact,” Clara continues. “It’s not in concerts or certificates. It’s in the eyes that light up when a child discovers they can be more than their circumstances.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I ask her advice for someone starting a project. She smiles: <em>“Start with what moves your heart. If it matters to you, it will matter to someone else. Keep going—even when the road is long, someone is waiting for your courage.”</em>
