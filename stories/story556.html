      <p>
        Elias had walked the same road for days, carrying little more than a pack and the weight of his failures. He had left behind a ruined business, a broken heart, and a future he no longer believed in.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the storm broke, he ducked into a narrow alley and found a door he swore hadn’t been there before. Above it hung a crooked sign: <b>“The Weaver of Dreams.”</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, the air shimmered with golden threads suspended in midair. An old woman sat at a loom that glowed faintly, weaving strands of light into fabric that pulsed like living skin.
      </p>

      <p>
        She looked up and smiled. “Every traveler finds me eventually. What dream do you seek?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Elias hesitated. He wanted to ask for wealth, for love, for a second chance. Instead, he whispered, “I don’t know anymore.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Weaver nodded. “Then let the threads decide.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She pulled glowing strands from the air and wove them together. As the cloth formed, Elias saw fragments within it — himself as a child, laughing without fear; himself falling, failing, rising again; faces of strangers he hadn’t yet met, smiling as though he belonged with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she finished, she handed him the fabric. It was warm, alive, and impossibly light.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This is not the dream you wanted,” she said. “It is the dream you have forgotten: to keep going. To believe you are not done yet.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Elias stepped back into the night with the cloth draped over his shoulders. The storm had passed, and though the road ahead was still uncertain, for the first time in years, he felt ready to walk it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him, the shop faded into mist, leaving only the echo of the Weaver’s voice: “Dreams are not escapes. They are maps.”
      </p>

      <h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

      <p>
        The story reminds us that the deepest dreams aren’t about escaping life, but about rediscovering our purpose within it. Sometimes, what we need most is simply the courage to continue.
