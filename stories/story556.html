        In a sunlit office adorned with sketches, books, and scattered coffee cups, Zara met Rafiq Khan, a visionary entrepreneur who had built companies that changed lives. He spoke not just about success, but about failure, resilience, and the quiet courage it takes to follow an unconventional path.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Most people chase what they think is success,” Rafiq said, “but the real journey is discovering what matters when no one is watching.” His words were layered with experience, failures, and moments of doubt that had shaped his philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the interview, Zara noticed how Rafiq emphasized empathy, ethics, and long-term vision over immediate gain. He spoke of mentoring others, of learning from young minds, and of creating spaces where creativity could thrive unrestrained.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of their conversation, it was clear that the real lesson wasn’t in the companies he built, but in the mindset he fostered — one that combined curiosity, humility, and boldness. Readers wouldn’t just read his story; they would feel inspired to examine their own choices and the kind of legacy they wished to leave.
