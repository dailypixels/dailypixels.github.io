      <p><strong>Part I: The Ashlands</strong></p>

<p>The kingdom of Elarion had burned for nearly a century. Once bright with towers of silver and banners of flame, it was now a land of smoke and shadow. The gods had fallen silent, and their shrines crumbled beneath drifting ash.</p>

<p>Arien Valen was born in the ruins — an apprentice fireweaver, taught to kindle light from nothing but air and memory. His master, old Magra, used to tell him, “Magic isn’t power, boy. It’s promise. It keeps the dark honest.”</p>

<p>When the embers in the Great Forge finally died, Magra sent Arien on a quest. “Go east,” she said, coughing blood. “Find the Last Ember. If it still burns, Elarion breathes. If not…” Her voice faded. “Let it sleep.”</p>

<p>He set out alone, with only a cracked lantern and his master’s rune-blade to guide him across the ruined plains.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part II: The Ember’s Whisper</strong></p>

<p>Days passed beneath a crimson sky. The wind carried the cries of things long dead. In the forgotten city of Draeth, Arien found it — a faint pulse of light within the hollow of a shattered temple. The Ember of Elarion.</p>

<p>It floated above a stone altar, glowing weakly, like a heartbeat on the edge of fading. When he reached for it, the ember spoke — not in words, but in warmth. Memories poured into him: the forging of suns, the laughter of gods, the first spark of creation.</p>

<p>“Why do you seek me, child of ruin?” a voice echoed inside his mind.</p>

<p>“Because without you,” Arien whispered, “we have nothing left.”</p>

<p>“You still have choice,” the Ember replied. “Will you burn again — or will you heal?”</p>

<p>He didn’t understand. Not yet.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part III: The Shadow That Feeds</strong></p>

<p>As he carried the Ember toward the capital, shadows followed — wraiths that had once been men. They hungered for its light. At night, Arien saw their faces in the dark — soldiers, priests, even children, all whispering, “Give it back. Let us rest.”</p>

<p>He realized the truth then. The Ember’s light had not just built Elarion — it had bound its dead. Every spark of divine flame was borrowed life, stolen from the quiet beyond.</p>

<p>“To relight the Forge,” the Ember warned, “you must feed me with what remains of your world. Every life. Every dream. All will burn again — or be freed.”</p>

<p>Arien trembled. “You ask me to choose between fire and silence.”</p>

<p>“No,” the Ember said softly. “I ask you to understand what fire costs.”</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part IV: The Decision</strong></p>

<p>He reached the ruins of the Great Forge just as dawn broke — a pale, colorless light. The Ember pulsed in his hands, begging to be born again. Behind him, the wraiths knelt in the ash, waiting to see what he would do.</p>

<p>He thought of his master. Of the stories of old. Of the endless wars, the burning cities, the gods who fed on devotion like hunger.</p>

<p>And he thought of peace — of letting the earth grow quiet, letting the flames finally die.</p>

<p>“Elarion was never meant to last forever,” he said. “No kingdom should.”</p>

<p>He opened his palm. The Ember flared — brilliant, blinding — then dimmed, dissolving into a thousand golden motes that drifted into the wind.</p>

<p>The shadows sighed in relief as they faded, their chains broken. The sky, for the first time in a century, turned blue.</p>

<p>Arien smiled as warmth filled his chest — the last warmth he would ever feel. The Ember’s voice whispered, “Well done, child of ash. You have given the world its rest.”</p>

<p>And when the wind passed, only his lantern remained — unlit, but whole.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Part V: The Dawn Beyond Fire</strong></p>

<p>Years later, travelers spoke of a valley where grass grew again, where the air smelled of rain instead of smoke. They said if you listened closely at night, you could hear a heartbeat beneath the soil — not of fire, but of life.</p>

<p>They called it the Valley of the Last Ember, though no flame had burned there since the boy’s choice. In that silence, Elarion finally learned to live again.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Last Ember of Elarion</em> is a tale about release — about knowing when to rebuild and when to let go. It reminds us that not all flames are meant to burn forever. Some are meant to teach us how to begin anew in the light of what has ended. 🔥🌿</p>
