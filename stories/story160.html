      <p>
        Harper and Mia had been inseparable since childhood, sharing secrets, dreams, and countless adventures. Life, however, began to pull them in different directions—college, work, and personal challenges created distance.
      </p>

      <p>
        One rainy afternoon, Harper received a call: Mia was struggling, feeling lost and overwhelmed. Without hesitation, Harper took a long drive to her friend’s apartment.  
        They met at the doorstep, soaked by rain, yet comforted by the familiarity of each other’s presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sitting together by the window, watching raindrops race down the glass, Mia spoke of self-doubt, fear of failure, and the pressure of expectations. Harper listened intently, sharing stories of her own struggles and reminding Mia of her strength and resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours passed, and slowly, the rain eased. Sunlight began to filter through the clouds, casting golden reflections across the room. They laughed, cried, and reminisced about the adventures that shaped them.  
        In that moment, they realized that true friendship doesn’t fade—it adapts, supports, and brings light even after the darkest storms.
      </p>

      <p>
        As they stepped outside into the fresh, rain-washed streets, Harper said, “No matter what happens, I’ll always be here for you.”  
        Mia smiled, feeling renewed hope, and together they walked forward, knowing that the bonds of friendship could weather any storm.
