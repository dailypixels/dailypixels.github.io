      <p>
        Reporter Elise had been investigating a series of mysterious disappearances at a historic theater.  
        Every witness mentioned a strange echo—voices repeating conversations that hadn’t yet occurred.
      </p>

      <p>
        Determined to uncover the truth, Elise sneaked into the theater one night.  
        The stage was empty, yet whispers seemed to come from the walls, and shadows moved unnaturally across the faded curtains.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a hidden backstage room, she discovered a set of mirrors and sophisticated audio equipment creating illusions that manipulated reality itself.  
        The mastermind had been replaying fragments of lives, trapping victims in psychological loops without anyone noticing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as Elise attempted to record evidence, a voice whispered her name—it was her assistant, someone she trusted.  
        Shocked, she realized he had been orchestrating the manipulations to control the headlines and the victims.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using quick thinking, Elise managed to turn the mirrors and speakers against him, exposing the setup and releasing the trapped victims.  
        Yet, in the theater’s final reflection, she noticed a figure she didn’t recognize, suggesting the echo chamber’s mystery was far from fully solved.
