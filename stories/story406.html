      <p>
        In a small Mediterranean village, the olive grove had stood for centuries. Generations had picked its fruit, pressed its oil, and gathered under its shade. But when war swept across the land, the grove became a place of whispers—of secrets, hiding places, and silent prayers.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Amal was a child when soldiers marched into her town. Her father hid resistance fighters among the olive trunks, while her mother whispered lullabies to cover the sound of hurried footsteps. The grove became both sanctuary and battleground.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, Amal returned as an old woman, walking slowly between the trees. Some still bore the scars of bullets, their bark hardened around wounds. Yet they lived, stretching toward the sun. Amal touched one and whispered, “We survived.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        History books rarely mentioned the olive grove. But the land itself remembered—the roots held stories deeper than paper. And as Amal’s grandchildren ran between the trees, she knew the whispers would carry on, reminding each generation of strength born from struggle.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The grove was no longer only trees. It was memory. It was survival. It was proof that even in war, life insists on growing.
