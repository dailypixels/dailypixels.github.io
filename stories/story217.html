        Rain fell softly over the quiet streets, turning the city into a shimmering mosaic of reflections. Lucas and Elara hadn’t planned to meet today, yet destiny brought them together beneath the glow of a streetlamp. Time apart had been long, and both wondered if the connection they once shared could survive the years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elara’s heart leapt as she recognized him. Without a word, Lucas extended his hand, and she took it instinctively. The rain became a gentle accompaniment to their reunion, each drop echoing the rhythm of emotions they had held in silence for so long.
      </p>

      <p>
        They walked side by side, sharing stories of years spent apart, triumphs, challenges, and quiet moments of reflection. Each word, each glance, reaffirmed the bond that had never truly faded. The distance had shaped them, yet it could not diminish what they felt for each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stopping beneath an ancient oak, Lucas held Elara’s face gently. “I’ve waited for this moment longer than I can say,” he murmured. Her eyes glistened with emotion. “So have I. Even when I doubted, I never forgot.” They smiled softly, letting the rain wash away the past and welcome a renewed sense of hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        They lingered in the quiet streets, embracing the gentle rain and the comfort of each other’s presence. Hours passed in conversation, laughter, and shared dreams, each moment a reminder that love, once true, is resilient, patient, and enduring.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the rain slowed and the sky began to clear, Lucas and Elara walked hand in hand, hearts aligned and spirits lifted. Their reunion was more than a meeting—it was proof that love can withstand separation, grow through challenges, and return when both hearts are ready.
