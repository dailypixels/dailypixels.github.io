        In the courtyard of her ancestral home, stood an olive tree older than memory. Generations had planted, harvested, and rested under its shade. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Sara’s grandmother often said, “This tree has listened to more confessions than any human could bear.” Lovers carved initials into its bark. Families gathered under it for meals. During wars, it sheltered those who fled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, as developers threatened to buy the land, Sara fought to save it. To her, the olive tree was not just wood and leaves—it was the soul of her family, the witness of their lives. 
      </p>

      <p>
        On the day the bulldozers arrived, dozens of neighbors gathered, chaining themselves around the tree. For once, progress paused. Some roots, they all knew, must never be uprooted.
