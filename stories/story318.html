        Monday mornings were bad enough, but for Tom, this one became legendary. At 8:47 a.m., the office elevator shuddered, groaned, and stopped between floors. Inside were Tom, his boss, the intern who always spilled coffee, and three strangers.

        At first, everyone stood in silence, awkwardly checking phones. Then the intern sneezed so loudly the boss jumped, spilling coffee down his tie. Tension cracked, and laughter followed. One stranger suggested they play “Two Truths and a Lie.” Another started humming elevator music ironically. Soon, the cramped space became a stage for ridiculousness.

        Tom, usually shy, confessed his hidden talent: impressions. To everyone’s surprise, he nailed his boss’s voice perfectly—earning a rare smile from the man himself. By the time the repair crew freed them an hour later, the group had exchanged numbers and inside jokes.

        “Worst Monday?” his boss asked, chuckling as they stepped out.  
        “Best one, actually,” Tom replied.

        For weeks afterward, whenever they passed in the lobby, they’d hum that same silly elevator tune—and grin like conspirators.
