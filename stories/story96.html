    <main class="story-content">
      <p> The village of Therin lay on the edge of the Hollow Woods — a forest so old that even the stars seemed younger. No one entered its shadow after dusk, for the trees were said to sing the voices of the dead. </p>

<p> Yet every full moon, a faint melody drifted from the woods. A song so haunting, so beautiful, it could make even the bravest heart tremble. They called it *The Song of the Hollow*, and it was said to lure wanderers to their doom. </p>

<p> But to <em>Elara Wynn</em>, a young healer’s apprentice, the song was not frightening — it was familiar. She had heard it since childhood, whispering in her dreams. Her mother had vanished to that very song fifteen years ago, and though the village forbade it, Elara had always promised herself that one day she would follow it. </p>

<p> On the night of her twentieth birthday, the melody came again — softer this time, almost pleading. Elara wrapped her cloak tight and stepped beyond the edge of the village torchlight. The trees seemed to move as she passed, branches shifting like arms reaching for her. </p>

<p> “You shouldn’t be here,” came a voice from the darkness. A figure emerged — an old woodcutter with silver eyes. He was the last man said to have returned alive from the Hollow. “The song isn’t calling you. It’s warning you.” </p>

<p> “Then why do I feel like it knows my name?” Elara asked quietly. </p>

<p> The old man hesitated. “Because it does.” </p>

<p> Deeper she went, the melody growing clearer until she stood before a great tree unlike any other — its trunk hollow and filled with a soft, blue light. The air shimmered with whispers. As she touched the bark, memories flooded her mind — not hers, but those of the forest itself. She saw centuries unfold: kings crowned and dethroned, cities swallowed by roots, the endless circle of life and death preserved within the wood’s heart. </p>

<p> And then she saw her mother — standing beneath the same tree, singing the same song. Her voice blended with thousands of others, creating the eternal harmony of the Hollow. </p>

<p> “Mother?” Elara whispered, stepping forward. </p>

<p> Her mother’s spirit appeared, radiant and sorrowful. “The woods keep what the world forgets,” she said. “We are its memory — every soul who dies unjustly, every dream cut short. I stayed to protect it.” </p>

<p> “Then why call me?” </p>

<p> “Because the balance is breaking. Men have begun cutting the outer trees, burning the roots for coin. The forest will awaken soon — and when it does, it will not stop until every blade of iron is rusted in the soil. Only one who carries its song can calm it.” </p>

<p> Elara felt her heart pound. “What must I do?” </p>

<p> Her mother’s eyes softened. “Sing with me — and stay.” </p>

<p> The choice tore through her like wind through glass. To stay meant leaving her people behind. To go meant the forest would destroy them. As the song swelled, she knelt beside the glowing trunk, tears streaming down her face. Her voice rose, trembling but pure. The trees shuddered. The wind stilled. And the forest listened. </p>

<p> When dawn came, the Hollow Woods were silent once more. The villagers found no trace of Elara — only a single new tree at the forest’s edge, its leaves the color of her eyes. When the wind passed through them, a faint melody played — a lullaby of peace. </p>

<p> The woods never attacked again. The old man would later tell travelers, “The girl became the heart of the Hollow. When you hear the song, don’t be afraid. It means the forest remembers mercy.” </p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
*The Song of the Hollow Woods* is a tale of connection — between people and the world they live in. It reminds us that nature has a memory, and every act of kindness or destruction echoes through it. Elara’s sacrifice teaches that true harmony is not won by power, but by understanding. 🌙🌲 </p>
