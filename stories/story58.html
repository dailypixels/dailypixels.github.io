      <p>
        When I woke, the first thing I noticed was silence.  
        No traffic outside, no birds, no voices.  
        Just stillness.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The room was bare—concrete walls,  
        a chair in the corner,  
        and a single steel door with no handle inside.  
        No windows. No clock. No idea how I had arrived.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Hours blurred together.  
        Sometimes the light overhead flickered,  
        sometimes it didn’t.  
        A tray of food would appear  
        whenever I closed my eyes long enough.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I tried everything: pounding on the walls,  
        screaming until my throat bled,  
        even scratching marks into the floor  
        to count the days.  
      </p>

      <p>
        On the 17th mark, the door opened.  
        A man in a white coat stepped inside.  
        He smiled too politely.  
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’ve lasted longer than the others,” he said.  
        “That means you’re ready for the next room.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        And before I could beg,  
        the light cut out—  
        and everything went black again.  
      </p>
