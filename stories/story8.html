        The plan was simple: a sunny afternoon picnic by the lake, sandwiches, laughter, and a frisbee or two. What could possibly go wrong? As it turns out—absolutely everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, the sandwiches were discovered by a squadron of particularly bold seagulls who swooped down like dive bombers, leaving us shrieking and scattering across the grass. Then Uncle Marco, in his infinite wisdom, decided to “improve” the blanket arrangement by shaking one midair—sending potato chips flying into a nearby toddler’s stroller.
      </p>

      <p>
        The chaos only grew from there. Someone’s dog, no one was quite sure whose, ran off with a baguette, sparking an impromptu chase that ended in the lake. Meanwhile, Grandma calmly sipped lemonade under the only shady tree, pretending she had never met any of us.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as the sun began to dip and the laughter echoed across the water, the disasters turned into stories. We huddled on the grass, damp and crumb-covered, watching the sky paint itself in pink and orange. The food was gone, the blanket was muddy, and the dog had claimed the baguette as his own—but it was, somehow, perfect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Families aren’t perfect, and neither are picnics. Maybe that’s the point. We’ll be laughing about this day for years, and every future picnic will have one unspoken truth: it can’t possibly be worse than The Great Picnic Disaster.
