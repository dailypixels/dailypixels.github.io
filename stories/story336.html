      <p>
        Every morning, Mrs. Carter sat at the same bus stop. Across from her, a young man scrolled endlessly on his phone. For months, they never spoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        One rainy morning, he shyly held out his umbrella. That tiny gesture broke the silence. Soon, their mornings filled with gentle conversation—weather, groceries, childhood stories.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Mrs. Carter fell ill and stopped appearing, the bench felt unbearably empty. But weeks later, she returned, frail but smiling, carrying cookies for her “bus stop friend.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The wooden bench became more than a waiting place. It became proof that kindness can turn strangers into something more.
