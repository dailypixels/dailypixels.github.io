      <p>
        The night the moon disappeared, the world fell into unease. Tides grew restless, wolves stopped howling, and children cried, unable to sleep under the heavy, starless dark.
      </p>

      <p>
        But one boy, Aiden, refused to believe the moon was gone forever. Standing on the hilltop, he noticed faint shards of silver drifting like fireflies across the fields. They pulsed softly, as if calling to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Armed with nothing but a lantern, he followed the trail. Each shard he caught glowed inside the glass, turning his small light brighter, steadier. He crossed rivers, climbed mountains, and braved forests where shadows hissed, all the while filling his lantern with fragments of fallen moonlight.
      </p>

      <p>
        At last, after many nights, the lantern was heavy with radiance. But the moon itself still hung absent in the sky. Aiden fell to his knees, despairing. “I gathered every piece… why won’t you return?”
      </p>

      <p>
        A voice, soft as wind through reeds, answered: “Because the moon was never broken. It was hidden, waiting for someone to remember its glow.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The lantern trembled, then burst open in a bloom of silver light. The shards lifted into the heavens, weaving themselves into a whole sphere once more. The moon returned, fuller and brighter than before, casting its glow over the land.
      </p>
<p>
  The villagers cheered, but Aiden simply smiled. For he knew the truth — the moon hadn’t needed fixing. It had needed a keeper of faith, someone willing to search for light even when none could be seen.
</p>

<h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

<p>
  The story reminds us that hope is not the absence of darkness, but the willingness to seek light within it. Even when something feels lost, it may only be waiting for us to believe again.
