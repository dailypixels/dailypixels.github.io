      <p>
        On the edge of a crowded city, where horns blared and neon lights swallowed the stars, a man opened a peculiar shop. There were no clothes, no books, no jewelry — only shelves of glass jars, each labeled with a single word: *Silence*.
      </p>

      <p>
        People mocked him at first. Who would buy silence in a world already full of noise? But one night, a tired office worker stepped inside. He paid for a jar, opened it at home, and was struck by an enveloping calm. No ticking clock, no humming refrigerator, no restless thoughts. For the first time in years, he slept deeply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Word spread. Soon, the shop was full of people desperate for peace: mothers overwhelmed by crying infants, businessmen burned out from endless calls, artists unable to hear their own thoughts. Each walked away with a jar, their faces softened with relief.
      </p>

      <p>
        The man behind the counter never explained how he captured silence. Some said he trapped it from caves, others whispered he stole it from forgotten prayers. All he said was, “Noise drowns truth. Silence lets you hear it again.”
      </p>

      <p>
        But not everyone used it wisely. Politicians bought silence to muffle dissent. Criminals purchased it to quiet their guilt. Lovers opened jars to avoid the difficult words that would have healed them. In their hunger for comfort, many forgot that silence could also hide what needed to be spoken.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, the shop was gone. The jars remained in homes, glowing faintly in the dark, both blessing and curse. And in the city’s new quiet corners, some people finally discovered the hardest truth of all: silence was not meant to be sold. It was meant to be chosen.
