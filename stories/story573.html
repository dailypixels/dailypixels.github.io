        Lina had always loved the rain.
It made the world softer, blurred the hard edges of grief. But that morning, when the first drops touched her window, she froze.
      </p>

      <p>
        The weather report said “light showers.”
Her heart said “him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet lately, when storms came, so did the music box he’d made for her — it began to play on its own. A faint melody. Broken but alive.
      </p>

      <p>
        One evening she followed it.
Through puddles that mirrored her trembling reflection, down to the old bridge where they first kissed.
      </p>

      <p>
        There, beneath the streetlight, stood Rayan. Or what was left of him — a shimmer, shaped by rain and memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why are you here?” she whispered.
      </p>

      <p>
        His smile was soft, like mist.
“Because you still remember.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The song ended. The rain thinned.
And when she blinked, the bridge was empty again — only her umbrella, open and waiting.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when she returned home, the watch she had kept beside his photo had started ticking.
      </p>

        Meaning / Reflection:
      </h2>

      <p>
        Some loves never leave — they simply change their language.
Sometimes, the rain speaks for the hearts that cannot.
