        Sometimes, the most profound lessons come not from scholars or leaders, but from ordinary people whose voices we often overlook. This interview was with an elderly woman named Ameena, who had witnessed three generations of her family rise and fall in a small town scarred by both migration and resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I sat with her on a wooden charpoy, she spoke slowly, as though each word carried the weight of memory. She told me about leaving her ancestral village during partition, carrying only a tin trunk, her younger brother’s hand, and the burning fear of not knowing where tomorrow’s meal would come from. She recalled the silence of the train station, broken only by the cries of mothers who had lost their children in the chaos. Her eyes glistened, but not from weakness—from the dignity of survival.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We thought home was a place,” she said. “Later, I learned home is wherever you decide to rebuild.”
      </p>

      <p>
        She talked about raising her children, about losing one to illness and another to distant lands that never returned him. And yet, despite all the losses, she smiled when she mentioned her grandchildren studying medicine and engineering abroad. “We sowed seeds in barren ground,” she said, “and even then, life found a way.”
      </p>

      <p>
        That afternoon, I realized interviews aren’t just about recording answers—they are about carrying voices forward. Ameena’s words, heavy with pain and light with hope, were not just her story. They were a map of resilience for anyone listening.
      </p>

        As we ended, she placed her frail hand on mine. “Write it down,” she whispered. “So no one forgets what it costs to survive.”
