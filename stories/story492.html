        The building had one narrow staircase that connected five apartments. Mornings there were a choreography of small courtesies: a nod, a lowered newspaper, the exchange of tea spoons. People learned each other’s rhythms by the sound of slippers on steps.

        Mrs. Javed left notes on the landing when she needed someone to water her plants. The teenager upstairs practiced violin at dawn; the neighbor on the second floor fixed his shoes on Sundays. Over the years, the staircase became their unofficial living room. Conflicts were shouted at the landing and then softened over shared sugar, apologies offered as bread.

        When a delivery truck knocked down the lamp post outside, the building organized a small repair fund. Strangers became collaborators. The young violinist played in the courtyard to raise money; the cobbler stitched donated boots for a raffle. The ritual of *good morning* extended into acts of care—the stairs a place where community was not announced but practiced.
      </p>

        Years later, when some residents left and new ones arrived, the staircase retained its echoes. People still paused, still offered a hand to carry a parcel up three flights. Small rituals proved more resilient than design plans; they outlasted paint jobs and renovations because they were habits of heart.
      </p>

        On winter mornings, a pot of tea still sat on the middle landing, steam like a promise. The building’s residents, scattered across the city, spoke of the staircase as though it had parented them: a narrow place that taught wide lessons about living together.
