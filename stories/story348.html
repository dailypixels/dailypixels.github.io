      <p>
        It was raining heavily when Lucia realized she’d lost her umbrella on the bus.  
        Drenched and shivering, she hurried along the street, cursing her luck.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside a bookstore, she spotted a bright red umbrella leaning against the wall.  
        A note was tied to it: *“For whoever needs it most. Stay dry, stranger.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        Stunned, Lucia opened the umbrella. Warmth spread through her, not from the cover, but from the kindness of the unseen giver.  
        She promised herself she would pass on that kindness someday.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks later, on a stormy day, she left her own umbrella with the same note outside a train station.  
        Watching from afar, she saw a soaked teenager pick it up, grinning wide.  
        The cycle of small kindness continued, one umbrella at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        And perhaps, in every city, little acts like these quietly turn storms into sunshine.
