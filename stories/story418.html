        Every morning, Ali poured coffee into the same chipped mug his grandmother had given him. Its stains told stories he had long forgotten—birthday mornings, rainy afternoons, and whispered secrets.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitting by the window, watching the street awaken, Ali realized life’s small rituals held the essence of memory. Each sip was a bridge between past and present, grounding him in gratitude and reflection.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, he shared a cup with his niece, recounting tales of his youth. Laughter echoed in the kitchen. The mug was no longer just a vessel—it became a connector of generations, a testament to the quiet continuity of life.
