      <p>
        The house at the end of Ashwood Lane had been abandoned for forty years. Children dared each other to touch its gates, teenagers broke in for thrills, and neighbors whispered about lights flickering in its windows at midnight. No one stayed long enough to uncover the truth.
      </p>

        When journalist Claire Morton moved to town, she dismissed the stories as superstition. Determined to write an exposé on urban legends, she entered the house with nothing but a flashlight and her recorder.

        Inside, the air was thick with rot and silence. As she moved through the hallways, she noticed family portraits whose eyes seemed to follow her. Her recorder picked up faint static, then whispers: <em>Leave…</em>
      </p>

        The deeper she went, the more the house felt alive. Doors closed on their own, the temperature dropped, and in the attic, she found a diary. It belonged to Margaret Ashwood, who wrote of her husband’s cruelty and her vow to keep intruders from ever disturbing her home again—<em>even in death</em>.

        Claire ran for the door, but it slammed shut. Her flashlight flickered, revealing a woman’s shadow lingering on the wall. The whispers grew louder. The last thing she recorded before the battery died was her own scream.
      </p>

      <p>
        The house remains abandoned. But if you walk by on stormy nights, some say you can still hear Claire’s voice, begging to be let out.
