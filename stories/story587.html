  The climb began before dawn.  
  <br><br>
  I carried only a flask of water, a journal, and the weight of too many unfinished dreams.  
  <br>
  The villagers called it “The Mountain That Watched the Sky.” They said it never slept, only waited — century after century — for those who came seeking something more than height.
</p>

<p>
  The path twisted through clouds of cold mist.  
  <br>
  Stones beneath my feet were smooth with time, each one a step taken by countless souls before me.  
  <br>
  Birds flew lower here, as if the air itself held memory.  
  <br>
  And above — endless blue, so vast it seemed to listen.
</p>

<p>
  Halfway up, I stopped beside a small shrine carved into the rock.  
  <br>
  Inside lay a bowl of melted snow and a single feather.  
  <br>
  Someone had left a note, edges worn thin by wind:  
  <em>“To climb is easy. To stay and listen — that’s the harder summit.”</em>
</p>

<p>
  I continued upward. The higher I went, the quieter it became.  
  <br>
  Even my heartbeat felt too loud.  
  <br>
  The mountain didn’t speak; it waited.  
  <br>
  So I sat — on a flat stone at the edge of the world — and finally stopped moving.
</p>

<p>
  Hours passed. Clouds drifted beneath me like forgotten thoughts.  
  <br>
  The sun slipped across the horizon, turning the snowfields to gold.  
  <br>
  And in that silence — deep, ancient, endless — I understood:  
  the mountain wasn’t watching the sky.  
  <br>
  It was watching us, learning patience from those who never stayed long enough to see it breathe.
</p>

<p>
  When I descended the next morning, I left my journal on the shrine — a single page open.  
  <br>
  It read: “Some places don’t want to be conquered. They want to be understood.”  
  <br>
  The wind turned the page gently, as if agreeing.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
  The Mountain That Watched the Sky reminds us that nature’s wisdom lies not in motion but in stillness.  
  To listen — truly listen — is the highest peak we can ever reach.
