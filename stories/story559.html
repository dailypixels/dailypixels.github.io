      <p>
        Mira loved walking through the old park on autumn mornings. The rustle of leaves beneath her feet, the cool bite of the air, the golden light spilling through branches—it all reminded her of gentler times.
      </p>

      <p>
        That morning, as the wind whirled playfully, a paper fluttered against the iron fence. Mira bent down and picked it up. It was an envelope, faded but sealed. On the front, written in familiar handwriting, was her name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her heart stilled.
      </p>

      <p>
        She tore it open, hands trembling. Inside was a letter, dated seven years ago. It spoke of dreams they had shared, promises never fulfilled, and a love that hadn’t died but had been forced into silence. It was from Arman—the boy who had left town with too many unspoken words.
      </p>
      <p>
        As she read, tears blurred the ink. The wind carried a soft laugh behind her. She turned.
      </p
      <p>
        There he was. Standing just a few steps away, older now, but with the same eyes that once had made her feel seen.
      </p
      <p>
        “I never thought you’d find it,” Arman said quietly, as though afraid she might vanish with the breeze.
      </p
      <p>
        Mira held up the letter. “It found me.”
      </p
      <p>
        They sat on the park bench as the leaves swirled, the world shrinking to two voices, two memories, and a love rekindled not through grand gestures, but through the simplest proof—that some words never truly disappear.
      </p

      <h2>Meaning / Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Love doesn’t always roar; sometimes it lingers softly, waiting for the right moment to return. This story reminds us that even after silence and distance, <b>the heart remembers what it was meant to hold.</b>
