        At dawn, when the world still sleeps, the wind carries a sacred hush. It moves between trees, bending grass with whispers too ancient for words.  
      </p>

      <p>
        To some, it is only weather. But to Layla, standing barefoot in the morning field, it was prayer. The wind brushed her face like a mother’s hand, reminding her she was alive, that each breath was a gift.  
      </p>

      <p>
        She closed her eyes and listened—not with ears, but with her soul. The wind told her that endings are only beginnings in disguise, that grief can be carried like seeds until it blooms as compassion.  
      </p>

      <p>
        In that moment, she understood: prayer need not always be spoken. Sometimes it rises wordlessly, like the wind at dawn—gentle, unseen, yet strong enough to move mountains.
