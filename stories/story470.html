      <p>
        The lighthouse keeper, Salman, had tended the coastal beacon for forty years. Alone through storms and calm, he kept the lamp burning, guiding ships safely to harbor. Villagers joked he spoke more with waves than with people, but they trusted his constancy.
      </p>

      <p>
        As retirement neared, he worried: when the lamp went dark, would anyone care? Would the world notice the absence of a solitary man’s devotion?
      </p>

      <p>
        On his final night, he climbed the spiral stairs with slower steps. He lit the flame one last time. To his surprise, the cliffs below were filled with villagers holding lanterns. Children, sailors, families — all carrying light. They shouted up: *“You kept us safe. Tonight, we keep the light for you.”*
      </p>

      <p>
        Tears blurred the sea and stars. Salman realized the beacon was never his alone. Each life guided safely ashore had carried a piece of it forward. The echoes of the lighthouse would live not in stone, but in the gratitude and courage of those who now stood holding their own lights.
      </p>

      <p>
        He descended with a quiet smile. The sea roared, the lanterns glowed, and for the first time, Salman felt he was home.
