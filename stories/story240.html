      <p>When Emily Carter woke up, she didn’t remember her name. The room around her was white and humming softly, a steady beeping echoing in the air. On the wall — a clock ticking past dawn. On her wrist — a thin hospital band with one word written: “Emily.”</p>

<p>Room 312 had no decorations, no photos, no flowers. Just a narrow bed and a small square window facing east. Through it, she could see the first light of morning spilling over the city skyline.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sweetheart,” said a nurse entering quietly. “You’ve been out for a few days. How are you feeling?”</p>

<p>Emily’s voice was hoarse. “Where am I?”</p>

<p>“Mercy General,” the nurse replied gently. “You were found unconscious after an accident. They said you were hit by a car near Riverside Avenue.”</p>

<p>Emily frowned. “Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>The nurse hesitated. “No ID. No phone. But maybe that’s something you’ll remember soon.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Days turned into weeks. Emily’s memory remained blank, but she found comfort in the sunrise through that tiny window. Every morning, she would sit by it, watching the light shift from pale gold to amber, spreading warmth across the sterile walls.</p>

<p>“That window’s my favorite patient,” said Mr. Anders, the old man in the room across the hall, who came by often with his IV stand. “It reminds me there’s something beyond these walls.”</p>

<p>Emily smiled faintly. “It’s strange. I don’t know who I was before this, but… I don’t feel empty when I watch it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re not supposed to remember the pain,” Anders said. “Maybe you’re supposed to start new.”</p>

<p>That night, she couldn’t sleep. She stared at her reflection in the windowpane — a face both familiar and foreign. “Who were you?” she whispered to herself. “And who are you now?”</p>

<hr>

<p>One morning, a new nurse came in carrying an envelope. “This was found in your jacket,” she said. “It got misplaced during intake.”</p>

<p>Emily opened it carefully. Inside was a single photograph: a little girl holding a kite, laughing on a beach. On the back, written in smudged ink — <em>Keep chasing the sky.</em></p>

<p>And suddenly, flashes came. The smell of the ocean. Her mother’s laughter. The feeling of wind pulling against the string of a kite. The voice saying, “No matter what happens, always look up.”</p>

<p>Emily pressed the photo to her chest and began to cry — not from sadness, but from recognition. She didn’t remember everything, but she remembered who she wanted to be: someone who still chased the sky.</p>

<hr>

<p>When she was finally discharged, Emily went to the beach from the photo. The sky was wide and blue, waves curling like gentle breaths. She lifted a small kite she’d bought from a street vendor and let the wind take it. It soared higher and higher until it became a dot against the sun.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes, feeling the pull of the string in her hand — a quiet, living connection between what was and what will be.</p>

<p>For the first time, Emily wasn’t afraid of forgetting. She had found something better than memory — direction.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Window in Room 312</em> reminds us that healing doesn’t always mean remembering what was lost — sometimes it means learning to see beauty again, even through a small window. Life may confine us, but hope always finds a way to shine through the glass. 🌅✨</p>
