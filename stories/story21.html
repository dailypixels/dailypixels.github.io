        The letter still sits in the top drawer of my desk, folded neatly in its envelope, the ink slightly smudged from the day I wrote it.  
        I had poured everything into those words—every unspoken feeling, every small memory that kept me awake at night.  
        And yet, I never sent it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We met on an afternoon that smelled like rain and coffee. You were standing by the window of the little bookshop downtown,  
        tracing your fingers along the spines of old novels as if they were old friends.  
        I remember thinking that you looked like you belonged to another era, someone who understood silence better than most.
      </p>

      <p>
        From that day on, every moment felt like a photograph:  
        the way you laughed with your whole body, the way you carried yourself like the world wasn’t heavy, even when I knew it was.  
        I memorized the way you stirred your tea, clockwise, three times, before taking a sip.  
        I memorized the exact shade of blue your eyes turned in the late afternoon light.
      </p>

      <p>
        The letter was supposed to be simple. “I love you,” I wrote, over and over, until it filled the page like a confession too loud for my own heart.  
        But every time I sealed it and thought about sending it, fear crept in.  
        What if it changed everything? What if you didn’t feel the same?  
        And so, it stayed here, with me, quietly holding all the words I was too afraid to speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years have passed now. I don’t know where you are, or if you still trace books with your fingertips,  
        or if someone else knows the way your laughter fills a room.  
        But sometimes, when the sun hits this desk just right, I pull out that letter and read it again.  
        And for a moment, it feels like you’re here—like nothing was ever left unsaid.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe one day I’ll send it. Maybe one day I’ll let you know that I loved you then,  
        and I love you still, in a way that time hasn’t been able to erase.
