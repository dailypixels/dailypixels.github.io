     <p> The rain had already soaked through his coat by the time <strong>Michael</strong> reached the bus stop. <br><br> The last bus of the night was running late — it always did on Fridays. He stood under the flickering streetlight, checking his watch like the habit mattered, though there was no one waiting for him at home anymore. <br> His marriage had ended three months ago. His son didn’t pick up his calls. And his job — well, that was another story that ended quietly. </p> <p> When the bus finally arrived, it groaned like an old animal. The driver gave him a nod — the kind reserved for regulars you never talk to. The seats were mostly empty, except for an old woman near the back clutching a faded red umbrella and a teenage boy sketching in a notebook. Michael sat halfway down and stared out at the rain tracing patterns on the window. <br> That’s when he noticed something odd — the driver wasn’t following the usual route. </p> <p> The bus turned down streets he didn’t recognize. The signs looked older, worn — as if they’d been there decades ago. Michael leaned forward. “Excuse me,” he said, “does this bus go to Eastwood Avenue?” <br> The driver didn’t answer, but the old woman looked up. “Oh, it goes everywhere,” she said softly. “Just depends where you think home is tonight.” Her words felt like a riddle, but he didn’t press further. </p> <p> At the next stop, the teenager got up and stepped off — into an empty lot filled with fireflies. Michael watched as the bus doors closed behind him, the world outside dissolving into darkness again. <br> “Strange,” he murmured. “There aren’t any lights like that in the city.” The old woman smiled faintly. “Not anymore.” </p> <p> The bus drove on. The rain stopped. Outside, the landscape began to change — not the city, but fragments of it. The diner where he met his wife for the first time. The playground where his son had learned to ride a bike. The corner store where his father once stood laughing with him under neon light. All of it — passing by like memories replaying on glass. </p> <p> “What is this?” Michael whispered. The driver finally spoke, voice deep and calm. “A ride through what still remembers you.” <br> Michael felt his throat tighten. “And where does it end?” <br> “Where you’re ready to start again.” </p> <p> The bus slowed. Outside, he saw his childhood home — the porch light glowing, the windows fogged with warmth. His mother stood there, younger than he remembered, holding the red umbrella. <br> “Go on,” the old woman said, standing now, her umbrella in hand. “This is your stop.” He turned to ask her name — but she was gone. </p> <p> He stepped off the bus into soft, dry air. The smell of rain lingered, but the house was empty. Inside, on the kitchen table, was a note written in his own handwriting: *“Be kind, even when no one stays.”* <br> He sat down and wept — not out of sadness, but release. When he looked out the window again, the bus was gone. </p> <p> The next morning, Michael woke in his apartment to sunlight through the blinds. His coat was still damp, his shoes still muddy — but on the counter lay a single red umbrella. <br> That day, he called his son. He didn’t say much — just enough to start. And for the first time in months, he didn’t wait for the last bus home. He walked. </p>
<p> <strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br> *The Last Bus Home* reminds us that life often gives us second chances disguised as ordinary nights. The people we meet, the moments we almost overlook — they can lead us back to ourselves. Sometimes, “home” isn’t a place we return to — it’s the courage to keep going forward, even after getting lost. 🚍 </p>
