    <main class="story-content">
      <p>It was raining again — the kind of steady, unrelenting rain that made the city blur into gray. People rushed down the streets, heads bowed beneath umbrellas, puddles swallowing footsteps. Emma Clark stood at the bus stop, drenched, because she’d lost hers earlier that morning.</p>

<p>She was late. Her coat clung to her arms, her bag was soaked through, and her mood had drowned hours ago. The day had started with a missed alarm, a spilled coffee, and a rejection email from a job she’d hoped for. The rain just seemed like the universe’s way of adding punctuation to her misery.</p>

<p>And then she heard a voice.</p>

<p>“You’ll catch a cold if you stand like that.”</p>

<p>She turned. An older man stood beside her, holding a large black umbrella. Without hesitation, he tilted it to cover her too.</p>

<p>“Oh—thank you,” she said awkwardly. “I’m fine, really.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look fine,” he smiled. “But that’s okay. Most people aren’t when they say that.”</p>

<p>His name was Walter. His coat was too big, his shoes were scuffed, and his umbrella looked older than she was. He didn’t seem to be in a hurry, though buses came and went. Instead, he stood there, humming softly, the rain drumming above them like a quiet song.</p>

<p>“Rough day?” he asked.</p>

<p>Emma exhaled. “You could say that.”</p>

<p>“I used to have those every day,” Walter said. “Back when I thought the world owed me something for trying.”</p>

<p>She looked at him, curious. “And now?”</p>

<p>“Now I just try for the sake of trying.”</p>

<p>Something about the simplicity of that hit her harder than she expected. For a long while, they stood in silence — two strangers sharing a small circle of shelter in the endless rain.</p>

<hr>

<p>When her bus finally arrived, she hesitated before stepping on. “Thank you, Walter. For… the umbrella, and the company.”</p>

<p>He nodded. “Keep it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t take your umbrella.”</p>

<p>“You can,” he said. “Just promise me one thing: when the rain stops, give it to someone else who needs it.”</p>

<p>Before she could argue, he smiled, turned, and walked away — no hat, no coat, no umbrella — disappearing into the storm like a figure made of mist.</p>

<hr>

<p>Days passed. The rain stopped, the sky cleared, and Emma found herself thinking of Walter. She carried the umbrella everywhere — through interviews, errands, and mornings when she still doubted herself. It became a quiet symbol of kindness, something she couldn’t forget.</p>

<p>Then, one afternoon, as she left a café, she saw a woman sitting on the curb, crying — her hands shaking, her jacket thin against the cold drizzle that had begun again.</p>

<p>Emma didn’t think twice. She opened the umbrella and placed it gently into the woman’s hands.</p>

<p>“You’ll catch a cold if you stay like that,” she said, smiling.</p>

<p>The woman looked up, startled, then grateful. Emma turned and walked away before she could ask her name — just as Walter had done.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the city, another story had begun.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning / Reflection:</strong><br>
<em>The Man with the Umbrella</em> reminds us that kindness is a ripple — what begins as one small gesture can travel farther than we ever see. We don’t need to fix the world all at once. Sometimes, it’s enough to keep one person dry in the rain. ☔💛</p>
