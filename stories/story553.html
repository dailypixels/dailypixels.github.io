      <p>
        Every stormy night, the lighthouse on Kettle Point vanished. Sailors swore it existed one moment, gone the next, leaving only a cold wind and the smell of saltwater. Jacob, a young cartographer, was sent to map the treacherous coastline — but he was determined to solve the lighthouse’s secret.
      </p>

      <p>
        On his first night, Jacob watched the lighthouse blink into existence as the fog thickened. Its light was unnervingly precise, illuminating only the cliffs but never the waters below. When he approached, the door swung open silently, though the structure had appeared suddenly in an empty field.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, Jacob discovered an intricate system of mirrors and gears — impossible by human hands alone. At the top, a journal lay open, filled with entries from a man who had vanished decades ago, chronicling how the lighthouse could “fold time” around itself. Those who lingered too long were swallowed by the fog, trapped in a loop of days that never ended.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jacob tried to leave, but the lighthouse shifted. Corridors twisted, ceilings lowered, and the walls whispered secrets he could not understand. He realized the lighthouse didn’t just appear and vanish — it lived, feeding on curiosity and fear, keeping its mysteries safe from the world outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dawn broke. The lighthouse was gone, as if it had never been. Jacob returned home, clutching the journal, unsure if he had escaped or been released. The world continued, unaware of the lighthouse that watched from the edge of reality, waiting for its next witness.
