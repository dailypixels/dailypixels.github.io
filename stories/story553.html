      <p>
        Clara loved old things. She combed flea markets for trinkets that felt like they carried stories. One afternoon, she found it: an ornate mirror, its frame carved with twisting vines and strange, unreadable symbols. The vendor shrugged when she asked about its history. “Came from an estate sale. Take it cheap if you want it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        At home, Clara leaned the mirror against her bedroom wall. It was beautiful, though a little unsettling. The glass seemed darker than normal, and when she looked at herself, her reflection always felt… delayed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first time it happened, she thought she imagined it. She waved. Her reflection waved back — a second too late.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next night, she brushed her hair. In the mirror, her reflection’s lips moved though she hadn’t spoken. Whispered words, muffled and foreign, pressed against the glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of the week, the reflection smiled when she wasn’t smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terrified, Clara threw a sheet over it. But at night, she heard scratching from beneath the cloth. When she tore it away, her reflection stood closer than it should have been, pressed against the glass as though trying to crawl through.
      </p>
      <p>
        She tried to sell it back, but the vendor swore he’d never seen her before. Desperate, she smashed it with a hammer. The glass shattered — but instead of falling, the shards hung in the air, each one holding her reflection staring back with hollow, hungry eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, one by one, the shards slid back together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, when Clara looks into the mirror, she no longer sees herself. She sees the version that waited — smiling, patient, free at last.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clara’s neighbors say the mirror hangs in her bedroom still. But no one’s seen Clara in weeks.
      </p>

      <h2>✨ Meaning:</h2>

      <p>
        The story warns of curiosity without caution. Some reflections are not meant to be looked at too long — for they may start looking back.
